</td>

<tr>
<td><p>The well-known authority on criminology, Dennis Holt,
inherited a house in a remote village, the sort of place in
which, to quote himself, &ldquo;nothing ever
happens.&rdquo;&nbsp; One night at fifty-three minutes past
eleven (he was always meticulously accurate about time), his
attention was attracted by a peremptory tapping on the window
pane.&nbsp; A moment later, the lower sash was slowly pushed up
and a young girl appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in!&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please&mdash;I have hurt myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a bewildering series of happenings
in the life of Dennis Holt.&nbsp; Suddenly he found himself
precipitated into the midst of a bewildering mystery, which at
one time seemed to threaten even his own liberty.</p>
<p>Patiently piecing together the ascertained facts, Holt
eventually presented a remarkable reconstruction of what had
taken place on that dramatic night.</p>

<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
A MIDNIGHT VISITOR</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">became</span> mixed up with the Clevedon
case&mdash;the Cartordale Mystery, as it has been called&mdash;in
curious fashion.&nbsp; True, it was to some extent in my line of
business, though I do not actually earn my living by
straightening out tangles.&nbsp; With me it is all a matter of
&ldquo;copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may or may not have read my various books&mdash;there are
eight of them now&mdash;on criminology.&nbsp; Their preparation
has led me into all sorts of queer by-ways and has given me a
curiously clear and analytical insight into the mind of the
criminal.&nbsp; I have solved many mysteries&mdash;you will
forgive the apparent boastfulness, but I have no useful Watson to
detail my exploits&mdash;but I stop there, with solving <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>them, I
mean.&nbsp; When I know the answer, I hand the whole matter over
to the police.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is your man (or
woman)&mdash;take him,&rdquo; I say.&nbsp; And sometimes they do
take him&mdash;and hang him.&nbsp; But occasionally they reply,
&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t take him&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t prove
it against him.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, however, is no business of
mine.&nbsp; I am a scientist, not a police official, and have
nothing to do with the foolery of their law courts or the
flummery of what they call their rules of evidence.</p>
<p>I have supplied the answer to the conundrum and that suffices
me.&nbsp; The mystery and its solution go into my notebooks, to
be used eventually for my own purpose, it may be to illustrate a
theory, or perhaps to demonstrate a scientific fact.&nbsp; I have
no desire to pose and no intention of posing as a worker of
miracles.</p>
<p>There is nothing marvellous about my methods nor wonderful in
the results.&nbsp; I do but proceed from fact to fact, as you
will see in this narrative, wherein I have set forth exactly what
happened, however foolish it may make me look.&nbsp; The reader
will accompany me step by step in my investigation of the
Clevedon mystery and will learn precisely how the solution, which
so bewildered and astonished the little group in Cartordale, came
to me.&nbsp; You <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>will see me groping in the dark, then you will discover,
as I did, a pin-point of light which grows wider and wider until
the whole story stands revealed.&nbsp; And if you guess the
solution before I did, that will show that you are a cleverer
detective than I am, which may very easily be.</p>
<p>I did not, by the way, go to Cartordale for the purpose of
investigating this particular mystery.&nbsp; I became involved in
it almost involuntarily.&nbsp; It was a queerly tangled skein
enough, and that of itself would have been sufficient fascination
to drag me into it, though I was deep in it long before any
intention or even desire to solve the puzzle manifested
itself.&nbsp; As a rule I carefully select my cases.&nbsp; Some
appeal to me, others do not.&nbsp; But in this instance I was not
entirely a free agent.&nbsp; I was in it before I quite knew
where I was going.&nbsp; That being so, it may be interesting to
explain how I came to be at Cartordale at all.</p>
<p>My Aunt Emily, to put it briefly, left me the house and the
money that took me into the wilds of Peakshire.&nbsp; I had never
met her in the flesh, and she, as far as I know, had never set
eyes on me.&nbsp; In point of fact, she never forgave my father
for taking to himself a second wife after my mother died.&nbsp;
But that is family <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>history and dry stuff.&nbsp; Aunt Emily made amends for
past neglect by her will.&nbsp; She left me about eight hundred a
year from investments, and the house at Cartordale, both very
useful, though I was not exactly a poor man.&nbsp; My books have
provided me with a fairly steady income for some years.</p>
<p>Stone Hollow, the house I had inherited, was a square, rather
gloomy-looking building&mdash;outwardly sombre, at all
events&mdash;situated at the head of Cartordale, a wild and
romantic valley in the heart of Peakshire, some sixteen miles
from the large industrial city of Midlington.&nbsp; The name,
Stone Hollow, had a comparatively recent derivation, arising from
the fact that the house was built on the site of, and largely on
the profits from, a now disused stone quarry.</p>
<p>The house itself stood on a sort of broad shelf, and behind it
a tall hill sprang almost perpendicularly upwards, still showing
on its face the marks and scars of former quarrying operations,
though Nature was already busy trying to hide the evidences of
man&rsquo;s vandalism behind a cover of green and brown.&nbsp;
Before the house, the ground sloped gently downwards towards the
Dale, while to the left was a stretch of heather clad moorland
lying between Stone Hollow and White Towers, the residence of Sir
Philip Clevedon.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>It
sounds rather well in description, but I will frankly confess
that after a very few days at Cartordale I was bored.&nbsp;
Though I had travelled widely, I had never actually lived out of
London and was always very quickly eager to be back there.&nbsp;
At first, I had done my best to persuade myself that a country
life was really the ideal and that it would provide me with quiet
and isolation that would be useful for literary work.&nbsp; But I
soon arrived at the limit of my resources in
self-deception.&nbsp; Which brings me to the night of February
23rd.</p>
<p>I was lolling on the couch in the room I had made my study,
pretending to work and succeeding very badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ever happens in a place like this,&rdquo; I
said aloud, with a yawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should become a hopeless
vegetable if I lived here.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t even write
another book.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t a chapter in the whole
blessed place.&nbsp; Neither robbery nor murder ever
happens.&nbsp; The folk wouldn&rsquo;t know the meaning of the
words without looking them up in a dictionary.&nbsp; Honesty is
the badge of all their tribe, and honesty, if commendable, is
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took up a batch of manuscript from the desk at my elbow and
began to read in rather desultory fashion, making a correction
here and there with a pencil.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Another delusion shattered,&rdquo; I
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say one can write so much better in
the quiet of the country than amid the bustle and distractions of
town.&nbsp; That is bunkum.&nbsp; This one can&rsquo;t,
anyway.&nbsp; I thought I would have made a good start with this
book, but I have done next to nothing, and what there is of it is
rotten.&nbsp; I could do more work in a week in London than I
shall do in three months of this.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll be
getting back next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I was wrong in saying that nothing ever happened in
Cartordale.&nbsp; Adventure was even at that moment coming
towards me with very hurried footsteps.</p>
<p>The time&mdash;it is essential always to be precise in
details&mdash;was fifty-three minutes past eleven, and the date
February 23rd.</p>
<p>It came, the beginning of the story, with a quick, almost
peremptory tapping on the window-pane and then the bottom sash
was slowly pushed up.&nbsp; I turned to the desk and took a
revolver from one of the small drawers, then strode across the
room and raised the blind with a quick rattle, half expecting
that my visitor would reveal himself in the shape of a
burglar.&nbsp; What I saw brought even me to a standstill, little
susceptible as I am to surprises of any sort.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>My
visitor was not a burglar&mdash;at least, not a male of that
species&mdash;but a girl, who looked young enough to be in her
teens, though she may have been a year or two outside them, and a
great deal too pretty to be wandering about alone at that time of
night.&nbsp; She was wearing a long, sleeveless cloak and a grey,
woollen cap, from beneath which part of her hair had escaped and
was blowing about her face in little wisps of bronze-gold
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please&mdash;I have hurt myself and I am afraid to go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stretched out my hands and, placing them beneath her arms,
lifted her over the low window-sill and into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strong you are,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>But even as she said that, the something that had kept her up
gave way and she lay a limp, dead weight in my clasp.&nbsp; I
carried her to the couch, but as I placed her down and began to
unfasten the long, grey cloak, I noticed that the sleeve of her
white blouse was stained with blood.&nbsp; That was evidently the
hurt to which she had referred; and I began to wonder whether I
had not better summon my housekeeper.&nbsp; It looked essentially
a case for feminine aid.&nbsp; The girl, however, was already
recovering.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;No, come here,&rdquo; she said, as I began to
move towards the door.</p>
<p>I returned to her side and gently lifted her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have hurt yourself,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See&mdash;your arm, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;there is
blood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s my arm,&rdquo; she replied, lifting her
cloak and showing a ragged tear in the blouse on the under-side
of the sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very bad&mdash;I
think&mdash;but it seems to be bleeding a good deal, and
I&mdash;I am afraid of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could
perhaps bandage it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a doctor&mdash;how nice!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied with a smile, &ldquo;I am not a
doctor.&nbsp; But I am a first-aid expert, enough of one, anyway,
to say whether or not a doctor is necessary.&nbsp; Yes, I have
treated much bigger injuries than this.&nbsp; It is only a
scratch, I fancy, and the blood looks more than it really
is.&nbsp; A very little blood makes a mess of things.&nbsp; Lie
still a minute.&nbsp; I have everything here within reach and
we&rsquo;ll soon put you right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I brought a pair of scissors and cut away the sleeve, finding
the arm beneath it&mdash;the left arm, by the way&mdash;rather
badly gashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you must show that to a doctor,&rdquo; I said
when I had washed and bandaged <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I will give you
a glass of wine and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone but you in the house?&rdquo; the girl
asked abruptly, as if some thought had suddenly occurred to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is my housekeeper,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and a
maid.&nbsp; Shall I rouse them and&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever
would they say if they found me here&mdash;at this time of
night&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, quite comprehending the hint so conveyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been visiting a friend,&rdquo; she went on,
observing me keenly through her drooping eyelashes, perhaps to
see how I took the story, &ldquo;and I&mdash;I lost my
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends should not have allowed you to attempt to
find it by yourself,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends are not plural,&rdquo; she retorted with a
little trill of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&mdash;or rather
she&mdash;she is a maiden lady&mdash;and I am not in the least
bit nervous.&nbsp; I am a country girl by birth and upbringing,
and the darkness means nothing to me.&nbsp; It is the fog that
worries me.&nbsp; I stayed later than I should have done, and in
my hurry to get back I lost my way.&nbsp; Then I saw the light in
your window and I came, meaning to ask where I was.&nbsp; I had
to climb <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>over a wall, and in doing that I cut my arm on some
glass.&nbsp; I think it is very stupid to put glass on
walls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be knocked off to-morrow,&rdquo; I
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the girl said
demurely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not likely to come this way
again.&nbsp; But do you know Cartordale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, know is hardly the word.&nbsp; I am afraid I
don&rsquo;t very well.&nbsp; I have only been here a short
time,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know very few
people.&nbsp; I have never seen you before, for
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a leading question very thinly disguised, but she did
not rise to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;it would be but
another instance of the blind leading the blind if I attempted to
guide you about the Dale.&nbsp; I will do my best if you will
tell me where you live, unless, indeed, you would prefer to stay
here until morning.&nbsp; The place is at your service and I
could very easily waken the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my visitor&rsquo;s negative gesture was very decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What house is this?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is called Stone Hollow,&rdquo; I told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know Stone Hollow,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;a lady with a curious name,
but I have forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Mrs. Mackaluce,&rdquo; I volunteered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the name, I remember now.&nbsp; I have
been here before, but never by the&mdash;the back window.&nbsp;
If you can put me on the roadway outside Stone Hollow I shall
know where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take you home, at all events, if you can show me
the way,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The girl looked at me for a moment or two doubtfully as if
that were not quite what she had intended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not right that you should be out alone at this
time of the night,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right and wrong are merely terms,&rdquo; she
replied, rising to her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no law against
being out at night.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t forbidden in the Defence
of the Realm Act, is it?&nbsp; If I like to be out at night it is
right I should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of the danger, not of the law,&rdquo; I
responded dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever danger can there be?&rdquo; the girl
cried, opening wide her pretty eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no
highway robbers in Cartordale, nor any Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I did not argue with her.&nbsp; I simply handed her the
woollen cap which had fallen off when she fainted, then helped
her to fasten the cloak <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>around her, and finally led her into
the hall, picking up my own hat and coat as I went.&nbsp; I was
fully determined on seeing her to her own home, wherever that
might be and whatever her objections.&nbsp; I opened the door
noiselessly and closed it again with the merest click of the
lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very dark,&rdquo; I muttered, being a man of the
town and used to gas-lamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it often is at midnight,&rdquo; the girl replied
demurely, but with a little catch in her voice as if she were
choking back a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can see very well.&nbsp;
Those who are country-born have eyes in their feet, you know, and
never miss the path.&nbsp; Why, there are men of the Dale, and
women too, for that matter, who will walk across the moors at
dark and never miss the path for all it is no more than three
feet wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have lost your way once already
to-night,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t affect the question,&rdquo; she
retorted scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only because I was
trying a short cut.&nbsp; I left the path of my own accord.&nbsp;
If I had kept to the road I should have been home by now.&nbsp;
The longest way round is the quickest way home.&nbsp; Is that a
proverb? It sounds like one.&nbsp; If it isn&rsquo;t it should
be.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>It is true, anyway.&nbsp; Besides, it is foggy.&nbsp;
That makes a difference.&nbsp; Give me your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently she did see better than I, for the next minute I
felt the grip of her slender fingers as she seized mine and began
to pull me forward.&nbsp; We went swiftly and in silence, still
hand in hand, for some minutes, then her clasp loosened.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the shadow of her lingered beside me, then
suddenly disappeared into the fog.&nbsp; We had reached a part of
the Dale that was flanked on one side by a wall of rock which
deepened even the blackness of the night and made the darkness,
to me, at all events, absolutely impenetrable.&nbsp; There was no
sign of light or house, nor indeed of any building, and when I
groped my way to the side of the road, I stumbled, first into a
ditch and then against a low rubble wall, beyond which was only
fog much thicker now than it had been earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>And it was there I lost her.&nbsp; How she went, or in which
direction, I had no idea.&nbsp; But I had no doubt that she had
evaded me of design&mdash;and that her home was nowhere
thereabout.&nbsp; That she knew the Dale intimately was
evident.&nbsp; She had deliberately led me to its darkest spot
simply that she might there lose me.&nbsp; I smiled grimly as I
realised that.&nbsp; She had fooled me <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>with incomparable skill and
wit.&nbsp; I paid a frank mental tribute to her cleverness.&nbsp;
A young lady of brains, this, and one whose acquaintance was well
worth cultivating.</p>
<p>I stood waiting for some little time&mdash;possibly ten
minutes or a quarter of an hour&mdash;then lit a cigarette and
walked slowly back to Stone Hollow, pondering over the queer
little adventure, wondering who the girl was and whether&mdash;or
rather when&mdash;I should see her again.&nbsp; She was evidently
an inhabitant of the Dale&mdash;her familiarity with it at all
events suggested that&mdash;in which case she could hardly expect
to evade me permanently.&nbsp; I must sooner or later meet and
recognise her.&nbsp; At any rate it was a piquant little mystery,
and I must confess that somehow Cartordale no longer seemed quite
so dull as it had been.</p>
<p>I had little idea then as to what the mystery, in which I had
thus become involved, really was or how quickly it would develop
on tragic and very unexpected lines.</p>
<p>I reached Stone Hollow again at 2.7 a.m.&nbsp; The whole
episode, from the knock on the window to my return home had
occupied two hours fourteen minutes.</p>

23</span>CHAPTER II<br />
THE TRAGEDY AT WHITE TOWERS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came down to Stone Hollow to
take over my new inheritance, I found the house completely
furnished on extremely comfortable if rather old-fashioned lines;
and Martha Helter in possession.&nbsp; She had been my
aunt&rsquo;s housekeeper for over twenty years and had evidently
every intention of being mine also.&nbsp; I was quite agreeable,
since it saved me a lot of trouble, nor have I so far seen any
reason to regret that decision.</p>
<p>Mrs. Helter&mdash;the title had apparently been accorded her
by courtesy, since she was still a spinster and everybody but
myself used it; but I began with Martha, her Christian name, and
Martha it is to this day&mdash;is a most capable manager and runs
my household with a precision that reminds one of well-oiled
wheels, and a careful economy that has its recommendation in
these days of ridiculous prices.&nbsp; She seemed to know and to
be known by almost everybody <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>in the Dale, and was an all but
exhaustless fountain of anecdote and news.</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;all but&rdquo; because she could not give me
immediately the information I sought regarding my pretty midnight
visitor.&nbsp; Not that I attached very much actual importance to
that queer incident.&nbsp; It had amused me, and perhaps, though
I would not confess it even to myself, I was just a little piqued
at being so cleverly outwitted by a mere girl.&nbsp; I had cause
during the day to revise my estimate of the interest I was to
take in my uninvited guest.&nbsp; But my first thought was to
identify her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; I said to my housekeeper, &ldquo;did you
ever meet hereabouts a young lady wearing a grey woollen cap and
a long cloak without sleeves, a sort of cape reaching to her
boots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martha Helter pondered the question for a minute or two, but
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have ever seen a cloak like that
in Cartordale,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw one yesterday,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I
wondered who the wearer was.&nbsp; Never mind, perhaps I shall
see her&mdash;I mean it&mdash;again.&nbsp; It was the pattern of
the cloak that took my fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not quite sure why I added that last phrase, though if
Martha noticed anything she kept a perfectly straight face.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;A grey woollen cap and a long cloak without
sleeves?&rdquo; said the little maid who entered the room at that
moment and to whom the housekeeper propounded the question.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, yes&rsquo;m, that&rsquo;s Miss Kitty
Clevedon&mdash;lives with her ladyship, you know.&nbsp; There are
two gentlemen to see the master,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them in,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are
they? Do you know them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is Sergeant Gamley, of the County
Police,&rdquo; Susan replied, &ldquo;but the other is a stranger
and did not give his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them in,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>Sergeant Gamley was in uniform, a tall, thin man with a long
hatchet face and an air of important solemnity which he never
shed.&nbsp; His companion was rather more rotund in build, with
puffy red cheeks above which peered small, keen eyes that did not
seem to linger long on anything, but which for all that missed
nothing.&nbsp; Abraham Pepster was chief of the detective force
at Peakborough, the county town, and one may judge to some extent
his prevailing characteristic by the fact that his nickname among
disrespectful subordinates was &ldquo;Gimlet-eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was, however, Sergeant Gamley who opened the conversation on
this particular occasion.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;We have called, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;with regard to the tragedy at White Towers.&nbsp; Sir
Philip Clevedon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tragedy&mdash;of what nature?&rdquo; I
interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard nothing of it.&nbsp; There
is nothing in the papers about it, is there?&nbsp; Or have I
missed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I interposed just then because I wanted to slow down the story
a little.&nbsp; The girl who had visited me last night was named
Clevedon&mdash;Susan had just told me so&mdash;and now there was
a Sir Philip Clevedon and a tragedy.&nbsp; I could not help
wondering, of course, what connection there could be between the
two, but I was determined to feel my way cautiously, resolved not
to be hustled or bounced into saying more than I wanted to
say.&nbsp; The story, whatever it was, should come from them
without any help from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Holt, I dare say you haven&rsquo;t heard
anything yet&mdash;not many have,&rdquo; Sergeant Gamley went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you say, it isn&rsquo;t in the papers.&nbsp;
You are a stranger among us&mdash;yes, yes.&nbsp; For the moment
I had forgotten that.&nbsp; I knew your late respected aunt very
well indeed, Mr. Holt. There was a little matter of a burglary in
this very house some four years ago.&nbsp; Mr.
Holt&rdquo;&mdash;he turned to his companion&mdash;&ldquo;has
been living <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>here only a very short time.&nbsp; He succeeded the late
Mrs. Mackaluce, whose nephew he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell Mr. Holt what has happened
at White Towers?&rdquo; the other man suddenly interrupted,
speaking in a small, soft voice that was rather curiously in
contrast with his bulk, and without any trace of
impatience.&nbsp; He had perhaps been as willing as myself that
the conversation should not be hurried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see White Towers from the upper windows of your
own house, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; Sergeant Gamley continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It lies between you and the village, a large house with an
outstanding turret and two smaller towers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but my
housekeeper said it was White Abbey, if that is the place you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good lady is a little mixed,&rdquo; was
Gamley&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>He was proud of his local antiquarian knowledge and delighted
to parade it, being, indeed, a frequent contributor to the local
papers and regarded as an authority on county history in general
and Cartordale in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Towers,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;stands on the
site of the old White Abbey.&nbsp; The older name survives, but
the present house, of which <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Sir Philip Clevedon is the
owner&mdash;was the owner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there is such a thing as an inward smile I indulged in one
then.&nbsp; The method was so obvious and I had so often used it
myself.&nbsp; Pepster was allowing the other man to go maundering
on while he himself kept me under careful observation.&nbsp; I do
not, however, allow my thoughts to be written on my face, and I
merely listened impassively.&nbsp; Pepster seemed at last to
recognise that he was not likely to get much help as things were
going, for he brushed Gamley aside and took up the story
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; he said bluntly,
&ldquo;Sir Philip Clevedon was found dead this
morning&mdash;stabbed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused there and I waited, making no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a lady&rsquo;s hatpin,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;a
big, three-cornered affair with a silver knob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a swift vision of a white, frightened face beneath a
woollen cap, but I could not quite connect the girl of the
previous night&rsquo;s visit with any thought of crime.&nbsp; She
did not fit into a picture of that sort.&nbsp; Yet I knew as
certainly as if she had told me that she was in some way mixed up
with it all.&nbsp; And why had they come to me?&nbsp; Did they
know of that midnight visit?&nbsp; I was determined that they
should <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>tell me.&nbsp; I would give them no lead.&nbsp; They
must do all the talking.&nbsp; Pepster, after a rather lengthy
pause, seemed to realise the position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you wonder why we come to you,&rdquo; he said
in his small, soft voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was merely on the
chance that in your late stroll last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they did know I had been out.&nbsp; Had they also seen my
companion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Sergeant Gamley&mdash;you stood to light a
cigarette and the match lit up your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepster paused there again with an obvious appearance of
waiting.&nbsp; Following the normal course, the person addressed
should now break into more or less voluble explanations of the
why and wherefore of this midnight stroll, explanations which the
detective could weigh as they came forth and so form some
estimate of their value or otherwise to the quest on which he was
engaged.&nbsp; There might be nothing in it.&nbsp; Pepster knew
full well that he would interview and interrogate scores of
persons during the next few days and would have to sift a
prodigious amount of chaff on the off chance of an occasional
grain of wheat.&nbsp; In any case he had to go on sifting.&nbsp;
That was his job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing your name was mentioned in the <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>way it
was,&rdquo; Pepster went on, &ldquo;I thought you might like to
explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I said inquiringly,
&ldquo;explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name was mentioned, you know,&rdquo; Pepster
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have told me.&nbsp; But what is it you wish me
to explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were out very late last night,&rdquo; Pepster
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be a trifle more explicit,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It comes to this&mdash;if you suspect me of having any
hand in killing Sir Philip Clevedon with a three-cornered hatpin,
you have no right to question me.&nbsp; It is against your rules,
isn&rsquo;t it, for you to trip me up and entrap me?&nbsp; If I
am not under suspicion I do not quite see whither your questions
lead.&nbsp; You may produce the handcuffs or take me into your
confidence.&nbsp; But in any case,&rdquo; I added with a quick
smile, &ldquo;I reserve my defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a bit off the rails, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; Pepster
returned with unabated calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know of nothing which
should connect you with the murder, nothing at all.&nbsp; But
your name was mentioned, and it is my duty to question everybody
who may be in the remotest degree linked up with the affair in
case by any chance they may afford me information.&nbsp; Do you
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>mind
telling me why you were out so late last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taking a stroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very foggy, unpleasant night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was extremely so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And consequently very dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That coincides with my own recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stroll in a thick fog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, you ask me a question.&nbsp; I answer it
in good faith, and you disbelieve me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not at all,&rdquo; Pepster said blandly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I accept your word implicitly.&nbsp; It was not the object
and inspiration of the&mdash;er&mdash;the stroll that interested
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&nbsp; You were not wondering whether I was coming
from or going to White Towers?&nbsp; I am glad of that,&rdquo; I
returned with apparently great satisfaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
point of fact the stroll was a mere whim on my part, induced
mainly, I may say, by the hope that it would assist me to a
night&rsquo;s sound sleep.&nbsp; I had been writing.&nbsp; One
reason why I maintain my cabbage-like existence in a
God-forgotten corner of the country like this is that I may write
a book.&nbsp; But writing renders the brain a little over-active
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke off there and waited for the other to continue.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&ldquo;What I really wanted to know,&rdquo; Pepster went
on, &ldquo;was whether you saw or met anybody during your
stroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw nobody and met nobody,&rdquo; I responded
equably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody passed a few minutes previously,&rdquo;
Pepster continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gamley here heard them talking, a
man and a woman.&nbsp; But he could not distinguish them.&nbsp;
He thought no more of it at the time, of course.&nbsp; Nothing
was known of the murder then.&nbsp; He recognised you only
because you struck a match to light your cigarette.&nbsp; But you
were alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded to Sergeant Gamley and picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be impertinent,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;to
inquire whether you have any clue, any idea, any
theory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never theorise,&rdquo; Pepster replied with bland
serenity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only story-book detectives who
theorise.&nbsp; Theories are too much of a luxury for
professionals.&nbsp; Facts are my stock-in-trade.&nbsp; I do not
travel outside those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the hatpin,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied vaguely, &ldquo;we have the
hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had evidently no intention of talking about that.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>When
they had gone I set myself down to concentrate my
thoughts&mdash;on the girl&rsquo;s woollen cap.&nbsp; I have so
trained my faculty of observation&mdash;just as a conjurer trains
his fingers or a dancer her feet&mdash;that I see everything even
to the smallest detail, though often without making any conscious
record of it at the time.&nbsp; When the girl fainted in my arms
her woollen cap had fallen off.&nbsp; Consequently there had been
no hatpin, though, as I visualised it, I remembered that on the
rim of grey cloth which bound the knitted shape, there were marks
showing that a hatpin had been in use.&nbsp; Was it with her
hatpin that Sir Philip Clevedon had been done to death?</p>
<p>There you&mdash;this to the reader&mdash;have the case set
forth, and you are in exactly the same position that I was
myself&mdash;a stranger to the place and the people, knowing
practically nobody and with every item of information yet to
seek.&nbsp; But we both of us have one small advantage over the
police.&nbsp; The latter, as far as I could make out, knew
nothing of Miss Kitty Clevedon&rsquo;s midnight adventure.</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>CHAPTER III<br />
A MEETING IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> not long to wait before
making further acquaintance with my pretty midnight
visitor.&nbsp; Our second meeting took place within a few hours
of the police call and on the same day.&nbsp; I had been out for
a long walk across the hills and was tramping steadily along the
high road towards Stone Hollow, when I saw, gleaming through the
darkness&mdash;it was already dark though only late
afternoon&mdash;at probably the loneliest and most desolate spot
in the Dale, the headlights of a motor-car evidently at a
standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a weird place for a halt and worse if
it&rsquo;s a breakdown,&rdquo; I murmured, and involuntarily
quickened my steps.</p>
<p>But as I approached the car I saw a moving light and then the
shadow of a woman walking towards me, carrying, apparently, a
small electric torch.&nbsp; Evidently she had heard my approach
and had set out to meet me.&nbsp; As she stepped momentarily into
the light of the car <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>I recognised her.&nbsp; It was the
girl of the midnight visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Kitty?&rdquo; demanded a quick, imperious
voice somewhere in the darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him to come
here.&nbsp; Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clevedon is in the car,&rdquo; the girl said a
little hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you come and speak to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a breakdown?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the girl responded, &ldquo;it is
Hartrey.&nbsp; We have lost him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I had no immediate opportunity of questioning her as to
the missing Hartrey, or the manner of his going, for
&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; as the old lady had addressed her, had run
to the door of the car and pulled it open, to reveal old Lady
Clevedon, white of hair, very erect of figure, rather stern of
face and with keen, searching eyes that just now were full of
wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do?&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can find Hartrey,&rdquo; her ladyship responded,
not exactly snappily, but quite ungently; she was evidently used
to giving orders, and it never occurred to her, apparently, that
I would do any other than obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Hartrey?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the chauffeur,&rdquo; the girl explained. <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>&ldquo;We
sent him with a message to Lepley&rsquo;s farm&mdash;it is over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed vaguely into the darkness, and I followed her
gesture with my eyes.&nbsp; But I could see no sign of house or
light or living creature&mdash;only the darkness and, in the
fore-ground, the blurred outlines of masses of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should not have taken him ten minutes,&rdquo; the
girl went on, &ldquo;but he has been gone for more than half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is the farm-house?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is rather queer we cannot see any lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think there are some barns or something of the
sort between the road and the house,&rdquo; Miss Kitty Clevedon
told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, besides, it lies in a hollow and the
rocks may hide it.&nbsp; I have seen the place before, but only
in daylight, and I forget just how it stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will allow me I will go as far as the house and
inquire,&rdquo; I said, producing my own electric lamp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Possibly your man has tripped over a
stone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tripped over a stone!&rdquo; her ladyship cried
scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more likely philandering with
the Lepley girl.&nbsp; Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied in the negative, adding that, indeed I had never
heard of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the only man in the Dale that <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>doesn&rsquo;t
know her,&rdquo; the old lady retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no,
there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the girl, but the men are crazy
over her, and Hartrey with the rest, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help being a little entertained by the idea that I
might be a competitor with the chauffeur for the favours of the
fair Lepley.&nbsp; But I did not put the thought into
words.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t an opportunity, indeed, for the old
lady threw off her rugs and made evident preparations to
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would wait here, I could go alone,&rdquo; I
ventured, thinking the search would be hampered rather than
helped by the old lady&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; But she did not
even answer me.&nbsp; She stepped from the car with an agility
which showed that her body was still younger than her years, and
herself led the way towards a gap in the tumble-down, rubble wall
where once apparently had been a gate.&nbsp; The car, I noticed,
was standing well aside on the rough turf that flanked the
roadway, and, in any case, there was little enough traffic in
those parts at that time of the year.&nbsp; We might leave it
there in safety.&nbsp; And accordingly the three of us made our
way along the very rough and uneven road that led to
Lepley&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the farmer&rsquo;s wife, who answered
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>my rap at
the door, &ldquo;Mr. Hartrey has not been here
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called to somebody who was evidently in a kitchen at the
rear of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he tripped ovver a stoan and hurt
hisself,&rdquo; the farmer&rsquo;s wife went on, &ldquo;though if
it&rsquo;s that it seems queer you saw nowt of him as you came
along.&nbsp; Besides, I don&rsquo;t know what he would be doing
tripping ovver a boulder, anyway.&nbsp; I reckon he knows the
road blindfolded, and there are no boulders to hurt if you keep
to the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have argued that point with her, for I had nearly
twisted my ankle on one group of boulders and had badly barked my
shins on another.&nbsp; But it was hardly worth while debating
it, since apparently Hartrey had not tripped over a boulder or we
should have tripped over him.&nbsp; At this moment, too, a girl
emerged from the kitchen, carrying a lamp held high so that she
might see who the visitors were.&nbsp; Her sharper eyes
discovered the two ladies, and she made a step towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and Miss
Kitty!&nbsp; Come right in.&nbsp; What is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was my first introduction to Nora Lepley, a young woman
of whom I was to know a good deal more before I finished with
her.&nbsp; <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>She was tall and finely built, with plentiful hair so
dark as to be almost black, and eyes that in some lights seemed
to be of a rich purple and in others of a sombre, rather heavy
blue.&nbsp; They were wonderful eyes and one had no need to
wonder that the men of the Dale should be, to use Lady
Clevedon&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;crazy over her.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
had then more admirers than she could count on the fingers of
both her slim, capably hands, and is still unmarried.&nbsp; I
think I know why, though I have hardly any right to say so.</p>
<p>She spoke with an educated intonation, in curious contrast
with her mother, who used the ordinary dialect of the Dale.&nbsp;
Beautiful, clever, educated, entirely self-possessed, she was
certainly something of a novelty to discover in a Cartordale
farm-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were at White Towers with your
aunt,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just run home to get some clothes,&rdquo; the
girl replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going back to-night to stay with
Aunty.&nbsp; She is terribly upset.&nbsp; But what is the trouble
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon retorted grimly,
&ldquo;that I have a fool for a chauffeur.&nbsp; I sent him here
with a message, but he hasn&rsquo;t been nor did he come back to
us.&nbsp; He went off into the darkness and apparently stopped
there, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>leaving me and the car on the roadway for anybody to run
into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he hasn&rsquo;t been here,&rdquo; the girl said,
with a decision that was evidently characteristic of her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wait until I get a lantern and we&rsquo;ll look for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clevedon followed Mrs. Lepley and her daughter into the
house, and for a minute or two Miss Kitty Clevedon and I were
left together in the porch.&nbsp; She could have followed the
others into the house, but for some reason preferred to wait
outside.&nbsp; Possibly she wanted to see what I would do.&nbsp;
She did not look at me&mdash;I noticed that&mdash;but stood near
the door, not quite with her back to me, but so that if it had
been light I could not have seen her face.&nbsp; She did not
speak to me, but I had of course no intention that she should get
off as easily as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your arm is better,&rdquo; I said, speaking
softly, so that no sound of my voice might reach those
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the girl returned icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expressing the hope that your arm was
better,&rdquo; I explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is nothing the matter with my arm&mdash;thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>The
girl&rsquo;s voice was perfectly cool and without the slightest
sign of flurry or perturbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may congratulate you on a wonderfully quick recovery,
then,&rdquo; I responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you&mdash;what was supposed to be
the matter with my arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told&mdash;it was rumoured&mdash;that you had cut
it&mdash;climbing a wall&mdash;a wall with glass on
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not climb walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you make a hobby of it, but every
one does queer things now and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as addressing impertinent observations to a lady
one meets for the first time,&rdquo; she rapped out.</p>
<p>There was a rather lengthy pause, and then I made one more
attempt to break down her defences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry to hear of the&mdash;the tragedy at
White Towers,&rdquo; I said softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a queer
coincidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if I thought to disconcert her by that remark I had
miscalculated.&nbsp; She made no reply, but simply walked a few
steps away and left me standing.&nbsp; Her acting was
perfect.&nbsp; I could not forbear a smile, though at the same
time I admired both her courage and her cleverness.&nbsp; Anyone
less alert would have admitted our meeting and tried in some way
to <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>secure
my silence.&nbsp; She did nothing of the sort, but ignored the
whole matter, putting up a big bluff in the assurance that since
there had been no witnesses to the little midnight incident I
should hesitate to tell the story lest I should not be
believed.&nbsp; Of course I knew very well that if I had really
been guilty of the impertinence of which she had accused me she
would not have received it quite in that way.&nbsp; However, I
had no opportunity for further efforts because just at that
moment the Lepley girl reappeared with a shawl over her head and
a big lantern in her hand, her mother and Lady Clevedon following
her.</p>
<p>We went slowly along in a sort of zigzag, going for six or
eight yards to the left of the roadway and then recrossing it and
covering a similar space on the opposite side.&nbsp; It was a
lengthy process and it was wasted time, because, as we neared the
car, we saw Hartrey standing by it, looking from left to right
into the darkness, evidently with rather dismal forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; Miss Kitty Clevedon cried in
accents of relief, but the tone in which her ladyship echoed the
phrase was quite otherwise.&nbsp; The latter approached the car
and demanded to know what Hartrey meant by leaving her alone
there on the high road and why <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>he had not gone to the farm to
deliver her message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost my way, my lady, in the darkness,&rdquo; the man
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I found myself at the bend of the road
higher up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Hartrey,&rdquo; her ladyship said severely,
&ldquo;when I engaged you I gave you extra wages on condition
that you should be teetotal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady, I have not touched anything of the sort for
nearly seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;what is your name?&rdquo; the old lady
demanded, turning suddenly on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Dennis Holt and I live at Stone
Hollow,&rdquo; I replied, amused and not at all offended at the
old lady&rsquo;s brusqueness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, nephew to Mrs. Mackaluce.&nbsp; I
remember hearing about you from Dr. Crawford.&nbsp; Well, thanks
for your help.&nbsp; Now, Kitty, come along.&nbsp; Good bye, Mr.
Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find your way back all right?&rdquo; I said,
turning to Nora Lepley, who had stood silent during the
conversation and whom the old lady had not thanked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I live here,&rdquo; she replied, with a quick
laugh, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t always come home by
daylight.&nbsp; Good night, Mr. Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Lady Clevedon had amused me hugely.&nbsp; She was
evidently what the country people <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>would call &ldquo;a character&rdquo;
whose acquaintance might be worth cultivating.&nbsp; But it was
the pretty niece who attracted all my attention, and I made up my
mind that I must become interested in the tragedy at White
Towers.&nbsp; There might be no connection between that and Miss
Kitty Clevedon&rsquo;s midnight wanderings.&nbsp; The latter
might be susceptible of the most innocent explanation.&nbsp; But
it was in that case a queer coincidence, and though I am far from
denying that coincidences play a large and weighty part in human
affairs, I instinctively distrust them.&nbsp; This might be one,
but until I could prove the affirmative I preferred to admit a
possible negative, or at all events to keep an open mind.</p>

45</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE SILVER-HEADED HATPIN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Midlington evening papers
reached Cartordale about seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; To accomplish
that they had to be printed somewhere about 3.30 p.m., and
accordingly were rather early editions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
one I saw contained a very good account of the Clevedon tragedy,
though, as I could well see, reading between the lines, one which
the police had carefully supervised.&nbsp; The press and the
police work in very much closer accord than most people
realise.&nbsp; They help one another, and the wise newspaper man
never gives away anything the police desire to keep secret.&nbsp;
In return for that the press receives all sorts of information
otherwise inaccessible to it.&nbsp; I have many thousands of
newspaper cuttings, all carefully indexed, of which I make good
use in the compilation of my books.&nbsp; Newspapers give the
facts that are known with creditable accuracy, though really what
remains unknown is frequently the more <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>important.&nbsp; The whole story is
not always told.</p>
<p>And the press may and often does materially assist the
police.&nbsp; If the latter wish to publish some item broadcast,
the description of some individual, particulars of a missing
weapon, details that may bring further items and possibly produce
an unsuspected clue, they go to the press, which very quickly and
efficiently gives them all the publicity they want.&nbsp; They do
not deliberately keep things from the press.&nbsp; Any such
attempt defeats its own end.&nbsp; It is the reporter&rsquo;s job
to get news and he is an expert at it.</p>
<p>But if you tell the press all you know with a reservation as
to what may not be published, the secret is safe enough.&nbsp; In
a very long and varied experience I never knew a newspaper man to
break a promise or violate a confidence.&nbsp; Some journals, of
course, make a speciality of crime investigation on their own
account, and clever enough they are at it.&nbsp; But even they
will suppress an item of news if the police ask it, and
frequently when they discover some fact unknown to the police
will inquire before publishing whether it is desirable or
safe.&nbsp; The ordinary man&rsquo;s idea that the press thinks
first and only of its news column is a delusion.&nbsp; Very <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>often a
newspaper knows a lot more than it says.</p>
<p>From the account in the Midlington evening paper I learnt that
Sir Philip Clevedon had dined alone soon after seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At the conclusion of dinner he retired to
his study according to his usual custom.&nbsp; At a quarter past
eight he received a visit from Miss Kitty Clevedon, who had
motored over from Hapforth House, the residence of Lady Clevedon,
with a message to Mrs. Halfleet, the housekeeper.&nbsp; Miss
Clevedon left before nine o&rsquo;clock, and at 11.30 Sir Philip
rang for his man Tulmin and ordered a whisky-and-soda, giving
also some instructions regarding a contemplated journey to London
on the morrow.&nbsp; Tulmin went off to bed, and thereafter was a
long blank from 11.30 or so until between six and seven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when Miss Nora Lepley found Sir
Philip lying dead on the couch in his study with the hatpin
driven through his heart.&nbsp; Those were the facts out of which
the reporter had made several columns.&nbsp; But the summary is
sufficient for my purpose.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a description of the hatpin, which was
eight inches long, with a flat, circular head of silver about the
size of a shilling and a three-sided or three-cornered blade of
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>steel that
tapered off to a very fine point&mdash;an unusual hatpin that
more resembled a silver-headed skewer or stiletto.&nbsp; It had
been driven into the body so that the head was close up to the
white shirt-front&mdash;as far as it would go, in fact&mdash;but
any bleeding had apparently been internal, since there was none
discernible either on the exterior of the body or on the
clothing.</p>
<p>I made a careful note of the times.&nbsp; Tulmin had last seen
his master alive at about 11.30.&nbsp; It was 11.53 when the girl
tapped at my window.&nbsp; When I had read the newspaper story I
sent for Martha Helter, my housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Lady Clevedon?&rdquo; I asked her, &ldquo;and
what relation is Miss Kitty Clevedon to Sir Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a little bit complicated, you see,&rdquo; she
said, seating herself on the extreme edge of a big
arm-chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady Clevedon is the widow of the late
baronet who died some years ago&mdash;before the war,
anyway.&nbsp; She was Miss Ursula Hapforth before her marriage,
and when her husband died she went back to Hapforth House, which
had been left her by her father, whose only child she was.&nbsp;
The Hapforths are older than the Clevedons in these
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps not so wealthy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know for that.&nbsp; They have
plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this Sir Philip&mdash;was he her son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I recollected that her attitude had been anything but that
of a bereaved mother when I saw her a short time before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she never had any children,&rdquo; Martha told
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then&mdash;but go on, Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been about to remark that Miss Kitty was not, therefore,
Lady Clevedon&rsquo;s daughter, but had thought better of
it.&nbsp; I should get more out of Martha, I reflected, by
allowing her to tell her story in her own way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Sir Philip was a cousin of the other
baronet,&rdquo; my housekeeper went on, &ldquo;and next to him
comes Mr. Billy Clevedon, who is Miss Kitty&rsquo;s
brother.&nbsp; He is in the army.&nbsp; They say that he and Sir
Philip quarrelled, and there are all sorts of rumours
about.&nbsp; Miss Kitty lives with Lady Clevedon.&nbsp; I believe
she has some money of her own, though I don&rsquo;t know how
much.&nbsp; Her father was a rector down in Cornwall, but
he&rsquo;s been dead a long time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this Sir Philip&mdash;where did he come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From somewhere abroad, I think.&nbsp; He was <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>not very
young, perhaps forty-five, and he wasn&rsquo;t married.&nbsp; We
didn&rsquo;t see a lot of him in Cartordale&mdash;he lived mostly
in London.&nbsp; He was not friends, they say, with Lady
Clevedon, though I should not think they had really
quarrelled.&nbsp; He was a stiff, solemn sort of man, and not
very popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact the Clevedon title was one of the oldest
surviving baronetcies, though there had been Clevedons in the
Dale long before James I invented baronets as a new means of
raising revenue.&nbsp; The Clevedons had all been politicians of
varying degrees of importance, frequently unimportant.&nbsp; A
minor Minister or two, a Colonial governor or so, a small
Embassy, all urbane, honest, honourable, but occasionally
unintelligent personages, belonging to what one might describe as
the great Official class, which has ruled England since the days
of the Tudors, doing most things badly but generally with clean
hands.</p>
<p>But the late Sir Philip Clevedon was something of a
mystery.&nbsp; No one had heard of him until the death of his
cousin had given him the title.&nbsp; He had never been in
Cartordale before that, and way entirely unknown even to his
relatives.&nbsp; They had no idea even where he lived.&nbsp;
Rumour was almost equally divided <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>between America and Australia, but
without any real foundation, since he himself vouchsafed no
information on the point.&nbsp; Among the people of the Dale, as
Martha indeed had told me, he had not been popular.&nbsp; He was
too chilly and unemotional in his manner and, being frequently
absent for lengthy periods, took no real part in the life of the
Dale and, apparently, little interest in its concerns.&nbsp; To
many of the inhabitants he was not even known by sight.</p>
<p>All this is a summary not only of what Martha told me, but of
what I subsequently gathered.</p>
<p>When I had finished with Martha I went out and met Detective
Pepster strolling in casual fashion through the village.&nbsp; I
should have missed him in the darkness but that we stepped at the
same time into the light cast across the roadway by the
&ldquo;Waggon and Horses,&rdquo; Tim Dallott&rsquo;s roadside
inn, famed far and wide among visitors to the Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been to arrest me yet,&rdquo; I said,
as Pepster returned my salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with a placid grin, &ldquo;we
are giving you a little more rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have taken a load off my mind,&rdquo; I returned
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But are you quite sure?&nbsp; <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Sudden
temptation, you know, and&mdash;and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are pulling my leg, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; Pepster
replied affably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did suspect me,&rdquo; I urged, wondering how
far the detective might be amenable to pumping.</p>
<p>Some of them are, but not those who know their job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suspect&mdash;that&rsquo;s rather a big
word,&rdquo; Pepster said thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, the
law says a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, but a
detective who knows his business proceeds the other way
about.&nbsp; Everybody is guilty in his eyes until the facts
prove their innocence.&nbsp; There is only one man I am
absolutely sure did not commit this murder, and that is myself,
but nobody save me has any call to be sure even of that.&nbsp;
Now you, for example&mdash;could you prove an alibi for that
night if I took it into my head to charge you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will suppose I could not&mdash;for the sake of
argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, but then, you see, something else is
required.&nbsp; Society is based on a notion that ordinary,
normal men act in an ordinary, normal manner and don&rsquo;t go
about murdering each other for the mere fun of the thing.&nbsp;
It is like <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>people walking along a city pavement while motor-cars
are dashing to and fro in the roadway.&nbsp; The three or four
inches by which the pavement is raised are no protection at all
should a motor-car take a sudden swerve, but pedestrians go
ambling quietly on in the knowledge that the normal thing is for
motor-cars to keep their own place, and that when they go wrong
it is because something has happened.&nbsp; Yes, Society is based
on the prevalence of the normal.&nbsp; When you hear, for
instance, that one man has killed another, you take it for
granted there was a reason&mdash;what we call a motive.&nbsp; And
the motive is vital.&nbsp; Sometimes the why of a murder reveals
the who, and sometimes the who explains the why.&nbsp; But the
two must go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your philosophy is both interesting and
accurate,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what of the
hatpin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the hatpin,&rdquo; Pepster replied
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that may have been an accident and
not the woman in the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman?&rdquo; I said inquiringly, my thought going
instantly to my midnight visitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, of course, a
hatpin does suggest a woman, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be a woman in it,&rdquo; Pepster went <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>on, gently
garrulous, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that the hatpin brings
her in.&nbsp; Some woman owns the hatpin, no doubt, but that
isn&rsquo;t to say that she used it.&nbsp; Though it does help
things wonderfully to get a woman into a case, even though it may
complicate it.&nbsp; No doubt there would be a man in it
too.&nbsp; There generally is.&nbsp; Women seldom play a lone
hand.&nbsp; But they have always been a fruitful source of crime
in men ever since Adam had to declare that the woman tempted him
and he did eat.&nbsp; I have always thought ill of Adam for
that&mdash;for telling, I mean.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the sort of
thing a real man would have blurted out.&nbsp; But for all that
it was true&mdash;it was true then and it has been true ever
since.&nbsp; Women&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as you say,&rdquo; I interrupted gently, &ldquo;it
would be a woman&rsquo;s hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it would be a woman&rsquo;s hatpin.&nbsp; Sir
Philip Clevedon didn&rsquo;t wear them&mdash;not that I ever
heard.&nbsp; And we have identified it, you know.&nbsp; It
belongs to Lady Clevedon and, as far as I can make out, Miss
Kitty Clevedon borrowed it when she went to see the housekeeper
earlier that evening.&nbsp; It will be in all the papers
to-morrow.&nbsp; There seemed no particular reason to keep it
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the newspapers, Miss Clevedon <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>went to see
the housekeeper, Mrs. Halfleet,&rdquo; I observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did she take her hat off?&nbsp; Where did she leave the
pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those questions have been asked and answered,&rdquo;
Pepster replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was caught in a shower of rain
on her way to White Towers and took off her hat to dry it.&nbsp;
She does not recollect where she laid the pin down, but it must
have been somewhere in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; She
did not see Sir Philip Clevedon and did not enter the study where
later the body was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The housekeeper&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knows nothing of the hatpin&mdash;does not remember
Miss Clevedon laying it down, and in fact never saw it until she
was brought to her dead master.&nbsp; It was Lady Clevedon
herself who identified the hatpin and told me all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that instead of one woman you have three,&rdquo; I
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, three women but not <i>the</i> woman.&nbsp; Hullo!
there&rsquo;s Dr. Crawford, and I want to speak to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded a quick farewell and went off with long strides
after the doctor.&nbsp; Considering his bulk and his apparently
leisurely methods of thought and speech, Pepster was curiously
quick and active in his movements.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Do you know Mrs. Halfleet?&rdquo; I asked my own
housekeeper when I again reached home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, quite well,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have known her for years.&nbsp; A little stand-offish in her
manner, but quite pleasant face to face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About how old would she be?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, let me see.&nbsp; I am&mdash;yes, she must be
quite sixty, perhaps a year or two older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a young woman, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no, not a young woman.&nbsp; She is the widow
of a minister, a Methodist, I think, who was at a church in
Midlington when he died.&nbsp; That must be a good sixteen years
ago.&nbsp; Lady Clevedon, who was living at White Towers then,
her husband being alive, brought her in as housekeeper, and the
present&mdash;I mean the late&mdash;Sir Philip kept her on.&nbsp;
She is sister to Mrs. Lepley, but far more of a
lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I switched the conversation on to other lines, leaving Mrs.
Halfleet for later investigation.</p>
<p>The case, you will note, has advanced another stage.&nbsp; The
weapon has been identified.&nbsp; The queer hatpin, with the
three-cornered blade and the silver knob, was the property of
Lady Clevedon, who lived at Hapforth House.&nbsp; Miss <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Kitty
Clevedon borrowed it and so conveyed it to White Towers where,
apparently, she left it.&nbsp; That was all very interesting and
quite simple, but probably irrelevant.&nbsp; The question was not
who had owned the hatpin or who had worn it, but who had used
it.</p>
<p>The question of time becomes interesting here.&nbsp; Tulmin,
the valet, had seen his master alive at 11.30, and the girl had
visited me at 11.53.&nbsp; She certainly had committed no murder
at White Towers in that interval.&nbsp; It was a physical
impossibility.&nbsp; I had carefully assured myself regarding
that.&nbsp; It would have required at the very minimum another
fifteen or twenty minutes.&nbsp; But I had lost her in the
darkness somewhere before 2 a.m.&nbsp; As I have already said, it
was seven minutes past two when I reached Stone Hollow again on
that night (or rather early morning), and allowing for the time I
stood after she had evaded me, and for the walk homewards, I
judged that it would be about 1.15 when she disappeared into the
darkness.&nbsp; What had her movements been after that?</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that I suspected the girl of having
had any hand in the tragedy, though I by no means ruled her
out.&nbsp; Her beauty and youth did not weigh with me at
all.&nbsp; <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>I had found both in even greater measure in proven
criminals.&nbsp; Besides which, a murder is not invariably a
crime.</p>
<p>But I had two ascertained facts&mdash;that Kitty Clevedon had
worn the hatpin to White Towers, and that she had been abroad in
the Dale during the early hours of that tragic morning.</p>

KITTY CLEVEDON AND RONALD THOYNE</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">met</span> Sergeant Gamley, the officer
who had called on me in company with Detective Pepster, and I
asked him whether the public would be admitted freely to the
inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I suppose they have
the right, but the accommodation is very limited, very.&nbsp;
When the witnesses and the lawyers and the family and the police
and the reporters and people who must be there are squeezed in
there&rsquo;ll not be a lot of room for outsiders.&nbsp; Did you
want&mdash;ah, now, I am looking for another juryman.&nbsp;
Stokkins has fallen ill.&nbsp; How would you
like&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;As long
as you don&rsquo;t make me foreman it will suit me very
well.&nbsp; I should like to hear the story in full&mdash;being a
neighbour, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not add that it would also afford me an opportunity of
seeing the body without making any obvious attempt in that
connection.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary country jury, consisting <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>mostly of
farmers, with a small shopkeeper or two, and Tim Dallott,
landlord of the &ldquo;Waggon and Horses,&rdquo; as
foreman.&nbsp; We visited the chamber where the body lay, but it
did not add anything to my knowledge except that I was able to
form some idea what the man had looked like in life, which did at
least add to the interest of the mystery.</p>
<p>An inquest is a singularly useless form of inquiry at its
best.&nbsp; It is doubly and trebly so when the police use it, as
frequently they do, for purposes of their own, to conceal the
truth rather than reveal it.&nbsp; The real duty of the jury is
to determine the cause of death, for, though it may declare that
So-and-so was a murderer, the actual demands of the law are
satisfied if the jury simply decides that a murder has been
committed.&nbsp; A coroner who knows his business does not travel
far outside the brief allotted him by the police, and generally
manages&mdash;though not invariably&mdash;to keep his jury within
the limits assigned himself.</p>
<p>I have had a long and very varied experience of inquests and
was not, therefore, surprised that the inquiry regarding Sir
Philip Clevedon&rsquo;s death should be merely formally opened
and then immediately adjourned, for the purpose, it was stated,
of a post-mortem examination.&nbsp; <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>I regarded that as a mere
subterfuge&mdash;in which, as it happened, I was wrong&mdash;and
easily realised that the police did not want as yet to tell all
they knew, which in its turn suggested that they had some sort of
a line on the murderer and did not desire to give him (or her)
any information.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I busied myself making some very careful inquiries
regarding Miss Kitty Clevedon.&nbsp; Through her midnight visit
to me, I was in possession of some information so far not within
the knowledge of the police, unless, indeed, she had herself told
them, which I doubted; and I intended, for a bit at all events,
to keep it to myself.&nbsp; Exactly what connection she had with
the tragedy I could not say, but I meant that she should tell
me&mdash;in which determination I reckoned without Kitty
Clevedon.&nbsp; I met her as she was walking from Cartordale to
Hapforth House.&nbsp; She was warmly clad in furs and, a little
flushed by the wind that was blowing smartly across the moors,
was looking very pretty and attractive.&nbsp; She saw me
approaching her and, curiously enough, made no attempt to avoid
me.&nbsp; In point of fact, I expected a direct
&ldquo;cut,&rdquo; but she stopped as I drew near and even held
out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy meeting you, Mr. Holt!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;I have just been to Hapforth House,&rdquo; I
replied, wondering what might be the explanation of her
unexpected cordiality, though I fancy that what she really had in
mind was to show that at least she did not fear me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&mdash;well, in fact,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I wanted a
word or two with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I turn and walk back part of the way with
you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
always prefer company if I can get it, and it&rsquo;s none too
plentiful here.&nbsp; I am used to lonely walks, though one can
have too many of them.&nbsp; A woman likes to talk, you know, but
one cannot converse with stone walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rattled on, rather intent apparently on doing most of the
talking, as if she did not wish to give me an opportunity.&nbsp;
But I merely bided my time, knowing the chance would come; and
presently she seemed to realise that, because she interrupted her
flow of chatter and turned as if waiting for me to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted&mdash;was it about something
particular?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The words were all right, but the mocking smile in her eyes,
and the set of her pretty lips, rather belied them.&nbsp; She was
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>preparing
to meet her adversary with a woman&rsquo;s weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about the night of the&mdash;of the
murder,&rdquo; I began slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of your visit to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put up her hand and with a pretty gesture pushed back an
unruly curl, meeting my gaze firmly and frankly and without any
sign of disquiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;my visit to your house, Mr. Holt.&nbsp; I do
not quite understand.&nbsp; Am I supposed to have visited your
house on the night of the&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intend to deny it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, if you consider that worth while I suppose I could
not prove it.&nbsp; After all, it would be merely my word against
yours.&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t such a subterfuge between us two
just a little&mdash;shall I say&mdash;grotesque?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell me all about it,&rdquo; she said quite
tranquilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I have lost my memory.&nbsp;
Such things do happen, don&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; But then there is
generally a railway accident, isn&rsquo;t there, or a motor
smash.&nbsp; And I haven&rsquo;t even knocked my head.&nbsp; Do
tell me all about it, Mr. Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help admiring the skill with which she kept me at
arm&rsquo;s-length.&nbsp; It was grotesque, <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>of course, as
I had said, but it was wonderfully clever.&nbsp; Whatever her
object, she certainly lacked none of the gifts and qualities of
an accomplished actress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your attitude suggest,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;that you have&mdash;er&mdash;something to
conceal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; she asked, opening her eyes wide.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wonder what it can be?&nbsp; Oh, yes, the night of
the&mdash;the tragedy.&nbsp; Are you suggesting by any chance
that I murdered Sir Philip&mdash;is that what you mean, Mr.
Holt?&nbsp; Speak out if it is&mdash;please do not
hesitate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then what have I to do with it all?&rdquo; she
demanded, stamping her foot as if she were really angry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must tell me what you mean, Mr. Holt.&nbsp; You have
said too much not to say more.&nbsp; What is it you
suspect?&nbsp; You hint at this and hint at that, but say nothing
straight out.&nbsp; It is a cowardly way to attack a
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice broke artistically, and she seemed to be on the
verge of tears.&nbsp; It was all very cleverly done, and I
confess I admired her, though that did not turn me from my
purpose.&nbsp; I have had to deal with women in all sorts of
moods and every possible disguise, though <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Kitty
Clevedon at that moment was less a woman than a clue in skirts
and furs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is quite simple,&rdquo; I said, deliberately
brutal, in the hope of startling her out of her calm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was only wondering what view the police, for example,
would take of your midnight adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go and tell them,&rdquo; she flamed
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;They might believe you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in my house on that night,&rdquo; I said, and
waited to see if she would deny the visit even to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you said before,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, then, wish to deny that you were in my house on
that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you believe me if I did deny it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not&mdash;how could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why should I trouble to deny it?&nbsp; You ask me
a question and answer it for me, and tell me you will not believe
me unless I adopt your answer.&nbsp; That is a convenient method
of cross-examining&mdash;put the question and invent the
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you will not deny it&mdash;why not deny it and
have done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holt,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I do not know
what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>That
was definite enough, and we walked along for some minutes in
silence, the while I considered whether I should press her
further just then or carry my inquiries in another
direction.&nbsp; I was, however, relieved of the responsibility
of immediate decision, for at that moment a man turned the bend
of the road and, seeing us there, came towards us and greeted
Kitty with the familiarity of an old acquaintance.&nbsp; She on
her part welcomed him joyfully, though whether that was from
pleasure at seeing him or because he provided a way of escape
from further questioning, I did not attempt to decide.</p>
<p>The new-comer was tall and rather heavily built and gave an
impression of immense physical strength.&nbsp; His manner was
bluff and frank and his eyes kindly and intelligent, but the
lines of his mouth were hard, as of a man who had had to fight
his way and would be little likely to give quarter to an
opponent.&nbsp; He looked like one who wanted much anything he
did want, and would leave nothing undone that might secure
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Honest in a way, but a tough customer,&rdquo;
was my own private summary, and I wondered who the man was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to Hapforth House,&rdquo; he said,
smiling, as he addressed Kitty Clevedon, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>though the
stare he bestowed on me was none too friendly.</p>
<p>I noticed that Kitty made no move to introduce us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Auntie told me she was expecting
you&mdash;some business matter, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I warn you there may be a warm half-hour
before you.&nbsp; Good-bye, Mr. Holt.&nbsp; It was very kind of
you to come this far with me.&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne is going my
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I accepted my dismissal smilingly and made a careful note in
my mind of the man&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Anyone with whom Miss
Kitty Clevedon was acquainted became a person of interest worth
knowing.&nbsp; On my way to Stone Hollow I met Dr. Crawford, a
Scot, rough of tongue and occasionally almost brutal in manner;
but he was implicitly trusted by the Dale folk, who regarded
suavity and gentleness with suspicion, and politeness as a form
of hypocrisy.&nbsp; He had come to them from a country even
wilder and sterner than their own, and was thus able to fit in
with their moods and to understand their temperament, which, to
strangers, seemed to be compounded of a mixture of sullenness and
stupidity.&nbsp; He was one of the very few people in the Dale
with whom I had struck up any sort of intimacy, possibly because
he had been my <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>late aunt&rsquo;s medical attendant and a witness to the
will that had given me Stone Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know a man named Thoyne?&rdquo; I
asked after a few preliminary remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; don&rsquo;t you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I supposed to?&nbsp; Is he one of those persons whom
not to know is proof of one&rsquo;s own
insignificance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would not say that, though it is a little curious
that you should have been some weeks in Cartordale without
hearing about Ronald Thoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, apparently I have heard about him,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;or I shouldn&rsquo;t be asking you questions
regarding him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not exactly one of his intimates,&rdquo; Dr.
Crawford said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is an American who fought in the
war with the French Army before the Yanks came in.&nbsp; He was
wounded or gassed, or possibly it was shell-shock.&nbsp; At all
events he came to England and was for some time in hospital, but
he seems perfectly fit again now.&nbsp; He settled here at
Lennsdale, which stands away up there on the hill-side.&nbsp; You
can just see the house through that opening.&nbsp; He is
certainly wealthy and gives generously, which is perhaps one
reason why he is popular round <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>here.&nbsp; He is bluff and hearty,
but rather too ready with his fists to fit our modern notions of
law and order.&nbsp; A good man to avoid a quarrel with, I should
imagine.&nbsp; He is very strong on the war and indignant with
his own country for holding off as long as she did.&nbsp; That is
about as near a character-sketch as I can give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; I must make his acquaintance.&nbsp; Is he
very friendly with Miss Kitty Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there have been
rumours&mdash;matrimonial&mdash;but nothing definite.&nbsp; If
they are formally engaged I haven&rsquo;t heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor turned into a small cottage standing by the
roadway, and I walked on alone to Stone Hollow.</p>

70</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
A NEW SENSATION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in Dr. Crawford&rsquo;s
surgery the day before the resumed inquest that I met Lady
Clevedon again.&nbsp; A little to my surprise she recognised me,
though, as far as I knew, she had only seen me in the dark, and
greeted me by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to know you, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; the old lady
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were a popular theme of conversation when
your aunt&rsquo;s will became known, and everybody wondered what
this London nephew might be like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I suppose that he, even though distantly,
approaches expectation?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that we really harboured
expectations,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon retorted bluntly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had seen your photograph, so that your features do not
come upon me with any overwhelming sense of novelty.&nbsp; Mrs.
Mackaluce showed me the portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know she had one,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
found it in the house.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t know how she got
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;I think she said her lawyer procured it for
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I quarrelled with his father and mother,&rsquo;
she told me, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to make it up with
him.&nbsp; But he is the only relative I have in the world, and
he has only me, and I shall make him my heir.&rsquo;&nbsp; Are
you really as lonely as all that, Mr. Holt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely?&rdquo; I echoed, perhaps a little
vaguely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you mean the only relative&mdash;no,
it&rsquo;s not quite so blank as that.&nbsp; True, my relatives
do not worry me much, but there are some about
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to settle in Cartordale?&rdquo; she
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slow enough as a rule, though
there is excitement just now, more than enough.&nbsp; Sir Philip
Clevedon stabbed and with my hatpin&mdash;it was my hatpin, you
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her lips together with what was almost a snap, as
if she feared to say too much.&nbsp; But she was not constructed
for long silences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man Peppermint, Peppercorn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepster,&rdquo; Dr. Crawford murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Pepster&mdash;thinks I did the murder.&nbsp;
Where did I last see my hatpin?&nbsp; Did I leave it at White
Towers?&nbsp; &lsquo;My good man,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I
haven&rsquo;t been in White Towers for three years.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t I friendly with Sir Philip?&nbsp; <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Had I
quarrelled with him? when did I last see him?&nbsp; Of course I
had quarrelled with him.&nbsp; Philip Clevedon was always
quarrelling with somebody.&nbsp; He was&mdash;but there,
he&rsquo;s dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused again and began to draw on her glove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late baronet wasn&rsquo;t exactly
popular&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popular!&rdquo; the old lady cried explosively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Popular!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left it there and, indeed, she had no need to go into
further detail.&nbsp; Her inflection on the word was
sufficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, anyway, I didn&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo; she went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a lot of difference between a desire to
box a man&rsquo;s ears and stabbing him with a hatpin.&nbsp; If I
stabbed everybody I quarrelled with I should have some busy
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your hatpin,&rdquo; I murmured, possibly in the
hope that I might irritate her into talking, a plan which, if
indeed I had really formed it, Dr. Crawford frustrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, you did not kill Sir Philip
Clevedon,&rdquo; he said roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a true friend,&rdquo; the old lady cried, with
grim and satirical humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank God! <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>somebody
believes me innocent.&nbsp; If I come to the
gallows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did not kill him,&rdquo; the doctor repeated
half sullenly, but with so much emphasis that I could not help
wondering what was behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know?&rdquo; Lady Clevedon cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps I did.&nbsp; I have felt like it many a time,
anyway.&nbsp; And it was my hatpin&mdash;as Mr. Holt reminded
me.&nbsp; Pepperpot suspects me at all events.&nbsp; But here
comes Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady drew Dr. Crawford aside and began to discuss with
him some matters connected, I fancy, with village doings.&nbsp;
Kitty Clevedon and I were left by ourselves in the huge bay
window that looked out over the rough, uncultivated garden.&nbsp;
The girl made no effort to avoid my company but greeted me with a
cool tranquillity that was, however, of that careful variety
which suggested some anxiety to show that she was not afraid of
me.&nbsp; For my part I merely returned a conventional reply and
stood looking out into the garden, leaving it to her to open a
conversation or not just as she thought proper.&nbsp; I took it
that, being a woman, she would, and I was not far out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your gaze on that garden seems very intent, Mr.
Holt,&rdquo; she said, with a bewildering smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you looking for something?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;Well, perhaps,&rdquo; I responded, with a
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I am always on the
look-out&mdash;for your double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My double!&nbsp; Have I a double?&nbsp; How
delightful!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said gravely, turning once more to the
garden; &ldquo;a double&mdash;someone so exactly like you that it
is very difficult to distinguish you.&nbsp; I should like to find
her&mdash;that other one.&nbsp; But I have had no luck, none at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so very anxious to find her?&rdquo; Kitty
asked, bringing that smile once more to bear as she saw that my
eyes were turned again in her direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment, none at all,&rdquo; I responded
lightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I find my present company fully
adequate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it that I make an efficient substitute?&nbsp; How
very sweet of you to say so,&rdquo; Kitty murmured, with a quick
glance downward as if at the slender toe of an exceptionally
pretty shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not remember saying that,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, you are you and she is
she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And never the twain shall
meet&rsquo;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that Kipling?&rdquo; Kitty
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may be quite safely asserted,&rdquo; I <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>said, with
grim meaning, &ldquo;that you will never meet your
double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed a little at the thrust but maintained otherwise
her smiling calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when did you meet her, Mr. Holt&mdash;did you ever
tell me?&rdquo; she asked, with a delightful assumption of
candour and innocence.</p>
<p>There was never a cleverer actress on or off the stage than
Kitty Clevedon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she flitted into my life through my study
window&mdash;and then flitted out again&mdash;into the
darkness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving you desolate&mdash;how very unkind of
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off with a quick trill of pretty laughter that was
not at all affected and in which I joined her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded a trifle sentimental, didn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; I said, and then added with tranquil insolence,
looking her this time full in the face, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t
there a proverb about better to have seen and lost than never to
have&mdash;oh, and that reminds me.&nbsp; I asked Dr. Crawford
where I should find another young lady like Miss Clevedon and he
replied, &lsquo;Impossible&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t one.&nbsp; God
broke the mould when He made her.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there is
another one, I know, because I have seen her,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;I should want a very solemn affidavit indeed to
make me believe that Dr. Crawford ever said anything so pretty as
that,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>I had expected to make her angry but she seemed only
amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know the doctor,&rdquo; I said
airily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is capable of much.&nbsp; But he was
wrong in this case&mdash;the double exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall ask him if he said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know, he might ask some awkward questions
in his turn.&nbsp; You see, I have never told anyone yet about
your&mdash;double.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I should care to
entrust him with the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why let it trouble you, Mr. Holt&mdash;why not
forget it&mdash;and her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not allowing it to trouble me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be always talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never mentioned it to a soul except
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty began, then turned
away to meet Lady Clevedon, whose conference with Dr. Crawford
had just terminated.</p>
<p>The old lady stood glaring at me for a moment or two.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;I dare say you think that we&mdash;Kitty and
I&mdash;take this&mdash;this tragedy very calmly, Mr.
Holt,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I thought about it at
all,&rdquo; I responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women sometimes wear a mask, Mr. Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be for a purpose or it may be by
habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced quickly at Kitty and found her surveying the old
lady with sombre eyes from which all the laughter had fled.&nbsp;
She at all events had been wearing a mask.</p>
<p>When the two ladies had gone Dr. Crawford and I sat down to a
whisky and soda apiece and a cigar.&nbsp; He seemed ill at ease,
restless and rather unhappy until I casually reintroduced the
subject of the Clevedon mystery, then he seemed in some curious
way to brighten up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, murder cases,&rdquo; he said reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A murder case can be very interesting, you
know&mdash;morbid but fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed without at all grasping his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a student of criminology and you have written
books on the subject,&rdquo; Crawford went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you ever run up against a case of poisoning with prussic
acid?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;Several times,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is a frequent and formidable poison because it is so swift and
unerring in its effect.&nbsp; The victim is dead before help can
possibly reach him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Crawford agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Death may be a matter of seconds, of minutes at
most.&nbsp; But, now, tell me, have you met cases in which a man,
having taken a dose of prussic acid, lies calmly down and is
found as tranquil and orderly in posture as if he had died in his
sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, I should
say the majority of cases were like that.&nbsp; Prussic acid is
said to produce convulsion, frothing at the mouth, and so
forth.&nbsp; Those do take place, and may in every instance,
though there are cases in which no evidence of them
remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; Crawford agreed, nodding his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, now suppose it were a case of suicide by
prussic acid, would you expect to find the bottle near at
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In nine cases out of ten&mdash;yes,&rdquo; I
responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the tenth?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might have been some other way of administering
the poison&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t there a case of prussic acid in
chocolates&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be possible for a man who had taken prussic
acid to conceal the bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible, yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;And if no bottle were found you would regard it
as a case of murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the murderer had any sense he would leave the bottle
near at hand to give the appearance of suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But murderers&mdash;sometimes forget&mdash;these
little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do, fortunately for the law.&nbsp; Nine murderers
out of ten are hanged by their own mistakes.&nbsp; But what is
your sudden interest in poison cases?&nbsp; Have you one
in&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have&mdash;Sir Philip Clevedon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Philip Clevedon!&rdquo; I echoed, for once
surprised into showing my astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; Dr. Crawford said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
died from prussic acid poisoning and the hatpin was thrust
through his heart&mdash;after he was dead.&rdquo;</p>

80</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">took</span> my place at the jury table
for the resumed inquest with considerably quickened
anticipations.&nbsp; Dr. Crawford&rsquo;s story had introduced
new factors into the case which promised added interest and a
still more involved mystery, though with a possibility of suicide
and, it might be, a vivid and fascinating life story.&nbsp; Not
that I indulged in any speculations.&nbsp; I wanted only facts
and those I expected the inquest to afford.&nbsp; I was not
disappointed.&nbsp; Of course, the doctor&rsquo;s evidence
startled everybody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the cause of death?&rdquo; the coroner
asked, when Dr. Crawford had concluded his preliminary
evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deceased died from poisoning by hydrocyanic
acid,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>This was news to most of those present, including the
reporters, who began to write feverishly, those representing the
evening papers, anyway.&nbsp; Here was a new fact, one even they,
so far, had not been allowed to know.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;That is what is known as prussic acid,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hatpin you have already described to us was not the
cause of death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deceased was dead when it was inserted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it have caused death had there been no
poison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, but not certainly.&nbsp; Death at all events
would hardly have been so rapid.&nbsp; With that wound the
deceased might have lingered for some time, for days
even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might eventually have recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner paused for a moment or two, then glanced at
Pepster, who shook his head slightly.&nbsp; For some reason or
other the police were not eager to pursue that particular line of
questioning.</p>
<p>Dr. Crawford&rsquo;s further evidence and that of the police
surgeon from Peakborough, who followed him, was largely devoted
to what one might describe as the technique of prussic acid
poisoning, unnecessary to detail here.&nbsp; There was, however,
one little fragment of evidence worth repeating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a small table by the side of the couch on which the
deceased was lying was a bottle half <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>full of whisky, a siphon of
soda-water and a glass.&nbsp; I took charge of them and later Dr.
Crimley and myself analysed the contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what results?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found no trace of prussic acid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any liquid in the glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about half an inch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No whisky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no prussic acid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the reporters again and saw that they were
writing their hardest.&nbsp; The trained newspaper man is never
at fault when it comes to selecting evidence.&nbsp; He seems to
know by instinct what is crucial.&nbsp; The longest report of any
case does not represent more than a twentieth part of the
evidence actually given, but the points are all there
always.&nbsp; And the reporters knew quite well that the absence
of poison from the bottle and siphon might make all the
difference between suicide and murder.&nbsp; Had the whisky been
poisoned Sir Philip Clevedon might have put it there
himself.&nbsp; There <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>was, of course, the fact that the
apparent absence of any medium through which the poison could
have been administered added to the puzzle, and the press dearly
loves a mystery&mdash;at least its readers do, and newspapers
that live by their readers wisely enough live for them also.</p>
<p>The next witness was John Tulmin, a little, thin man, not more
than about five feet three in height and correspondingly meagre
in build, who had been the late baronet&rsquo;s personal servant,
possessed, apparently, of sufficient education occasionally to do
secretarial work for him.&nbsp; At all events he opened Sir
Philip&rsquo;s letters and typed the replies dictated by his
employer.&nbsp; But he also acted as valet and was apparently as
clever with clothes brush and razor as he was with the
typewriter.&nbsp; He gave his evidence clearly and without
hesitation, and seemed quite unaware of any reason why he should
be an object of considerable interest to Police, Press and
Public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time did you last see Sir Philip Clevedon
alive?&rdquo; the coroner asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At thirty-three minutes past eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very precise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am precise because I am stating the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What enables you to fix the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;As I was leaving the room Sir Philip asked me for
the time and set his watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that usual with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, but he had complained during the day that his
watch seemed to be losing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; He asked you the time and you told
him&mdash;&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven thirty-three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that from your own watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your watch was right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;That will be all, Tulmin, good
night.&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied, &lsquo;Good night, Sir
Philip,&rsquo; and had reached the door when he called me
back.&nbsp; &lsquo;And, by the way, Tulmin,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;waken me at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I want to catch the
10.15 to London.&nbsp; Order me the car at 9.30 will
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;Very good, Sir Philip,&rsquo;
and then I left the room, closing the door behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told you to call him at eight
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to have the car round at 9.30?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;Because he was catching the 10.15 to
London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very important matter, gentlemen,&rdquo; the
coroner said, turning to the jury.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has some
bearing on the possibility of suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at Pepster, whose face was wrinkled in a quiet
grin.&nbsp; Really, such orders had no bearing at all on the
question of suicide&mdash;they were just such as a man might give
who had determined to take his own life but desired to conceal
the truth.&nbsp; A person bent on suicide&mdash;though
&ldquo;temporary insanity&rdquo; is usually the verdict of kindly
juries&mdash;can manifest very considerable skill, and frequently
does, in covering up the real mode of his exit from this
life.&nbsp; Scores of cases of
&ldquo;accident&rdquo;&mdash;according to the verdict&mdash;in my
experience have been suicide disguised.&nbsp; Men and women who
have been killed on the railway, or run over by motor-cars, or
drowned while bathing, or shot while cleaning a gun, or swallowed
poison from bottles labelled something else, have carefully
arranged those happenings, chiefly for the benefit of insurance
companies.&nbsp; Suicide is much more frequent than is generally
supposed, and it is far more often the result of careful
calculation and arrangement than of insanity, temporary or
otherwise.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;Did Sir Philip give you any order when he rang
for you?&rdquo; the coroner went on, continuing his examination
of Tulmin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me to bring him a whisky and
soda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought him a bottle of whisky, a siphon of
soda-water and a glass, and I placed them on a small table which
I drew up to the side of the couch on which Sir Philip was
reclining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much whisky was there in the bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about half full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this bottle kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on the sideboard in the dining-room.&nbsp; Sir
Philip always had whisky and soda for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the bottle you took him at night the same bottle
out of which Sir Philip had had whisky at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;quite.&nbsp; I poured it out myself at
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the point of my question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but we will return to that later.&nbsp; As far as
you know, the bottle you took Sir Philip <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>was the one
from which you had given him whisky at dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure it was the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess I did not quite see the bearing of that question,
but I gathered from Pepster&rsquo;s attitude that he, at all
events, attached some importance to it, and I was content to
wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Sir Philip drink only one brand of
whisky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, always the same; Lambert&rsquo;s Blue
Label.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many bottles have you of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite certain, but about eight dozen, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us come to the following morning.&nbsp; How did
you hear of the&mdash;the tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lepley awakened me, and I went straight to the
study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the small table by the side of the
couch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the whisky bottle there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the siphon and the glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you had put them the night before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;Now here is the bottle of whisky that was found
on the table by Sir Philip&rsquo;s side&rdquo;&mdash;Pepster
produced it from a bag he had been hitherto carefully
guarding&mdash;&ldquo;is that the bottle from which you gave your
employer a drink at dinner and which you left with him at
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you identify it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lambert&rsquo;s Blue Label, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is a popular brand, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I believe it is, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could buy a bottle in Midlington, for
example?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, at several places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any special marks on this particular
bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you identify it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Lambert&rsquo;s Blue Label, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, and we may leave it there.&nbsp; As far as you
know, that bottle is the one from which you gave Sir Philip his
drink at dinner, and which you took him at night, but there are
no marks on it which enable you to identify it
positively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, one bottle of Lambert&rsquo;s Blue
Label is very like another.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; Did you notice the
glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you say whether it was the glass you took Sir
Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same sort of glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite an ordinary glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many glasses of that type in the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, several dozen, I should think.&nbsp; The
housekeeper or the butler would know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&nbsp; There was nothing special about the
glass, any more than about the bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the end of this very curious cross-examination, the
exact bearing of which did not occur to me immediately.</p>
<p>The next witness was Miss Nora Lepley, niece to Mrs. Halfleet,
the housekeeper.&nbsp; The name seemed familiar to me, and for a
moment or two I puzzled over it.&nbsp; But when I saw the girl, I
remembered.&nbsp; Indeed, she was not of the type that is easily
forgotten.&nbsp; It was the girl of the farm-house at which we
had called in search of Lady Clevedon&rsquo;s missing
chauffeur.&nbsp; It seemed that she was staying with her aunt, <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Mrs.
Halfleet, for a few days, and she it was that made the first
discovery of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you who found Sir
Philip&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;who first saw&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I found Sir Philip lying dead on his couch in
the study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time would that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came you to be the first to enter the
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody was allowed to tidy Sir Philip&rsquo;s study
except my aunt, and she had to be there when the maids were
cleaning.&nbsp; But when I was staying with her at White Towers,
I sometimes looked after it for her.&nbsp; Sir Philip knew, and
didn&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you friendly with Sir Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not particularly.&nbsp; I seldom saw him, and
when I did he generally didn&rsquo;t speak to me.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t very&mdash;very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is genial the word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled, but quickly composed her features again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us come to this particular morning.&nbsp; Tell
me exactly what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt wakened me and said would I straighten Sir
Philip&rsquo;s study for her, as he would <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>be down
early.&nbsp; I think she said he was going to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time would it be when she wakened you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think about a quarter to seven.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t say to the minute, because I did not look at my
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dressed, and went downstairs to the study.&nbsp; As I
opened the door I saw that the light was still burning, and that
Sir Philip was lying on the couch.&nbsp; I thought he had fallen
asleep there overnight.&nbsp; I went to him and put my hand on
his shoulder, intending to waken him, and then I
saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused there, and her face whitened a little at the
recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that he was dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you tried to awaken him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had shaken his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran out of the room and fetched my aunt who sent me
for Mr. Chinley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the butler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then I went for Mr. Tulmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; Indeed, he was half dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Did he open the door directly you
knocked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would not be sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I may have knocked twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tulmin go with you immediately to the
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then he ran off for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remained with my aunt and Mr. Chinley in the study
until the doctor came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I want you to consider very carefully this next
question; when you saw that Sir Philip was dead, did you examine
him at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not wait for that.&nbsp; I ran straight out
to bring help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the hatpin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I saw nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean that it wasn&rsquo;t there, or that you
did not notice it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been there.&nbsp; Indeed, I suppose it must
have been, but I did not see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You formed no idea as to how he had died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I formed no ideas of any sort.&nbsp; I think I was too
frightened and upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Lepley,&rdquo; the coroner <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have given your evidence very clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I could not remember about the
hatpin,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I have no doubt we shall trace it in
time.&nbsp; And now we will have Mrs. Halfleet, the
housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE STORY OF A QUARREL</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inquest, as far as it had gone,
afforded no leading at all.&nbsp; We had not even learned how the
poison had been administered, for though there had been some
suggestion of possible juggling with the whisky bottle and glass,
there had been nothing definite.&nbsp; But it was the hatpin that
puzzled me most.&nbsp; One might regard it as certain, at all
events, that Sir Philip Clevedon, even if he had voluntarily
taken the poison, had not thereafter stabbed himself.&nbsp; One
could only suppose that it was the murderer&rsquo;s effort to
make absolutely sure that his work was complete.&nbsp; Without
the hatpin it might have been odds in favour of suicide.</p>
<p>Mrs. Halfleet, the housekeeper, was a tall woman, something
past middle-age, with black hair lightly streaked with grey, and
dark eyes of a peculiarly penetrating quality.&nbsp; I wondered
for a moment if or where I had seen her before, and then I
realised that it was her likeness to <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>her niece that had impressed
me.&nbsp; She was very alert, both mentally and physically,
answered the questions in full and without hesitation, and yet
with a curious air of detachment as if, after all, it were no
particular business of hers.&nbsp; She described events already
dealt with here, and generally corroborated the evidence that had
gone before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you now about this hatpin,&rdquo; the
coroner said, picking up the pretty but sinister little
weapon.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were the first to discover the&mdash;the
use to which it had been put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw it and called Mr. Chinley&rsquo;s attention
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you seen it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I can recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a visitor during the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she remove her hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she had been caught in the rain, and her hat was
very wet.&nbsp; I advised her to take it off and dry it before my
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Miss Clevedon took off her hat, did you see her
remove the pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;Did you see where she put it down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not see her put it on the table, for instance,
or the mantelpiece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not notice it lying about after she had
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Clevedon see Sir Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went to his study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether she saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she went straight out after that, and did not
return to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Clevedon resume her hat before she went to the
study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she was carrying it in her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember her remarking that it was still damp,
and that she would put it on when she got outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not recollect whether she had the hatpin in her
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Sir Philip Clevedon have any other
visitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, earlier in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before or after dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before dinner&mdash;about six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;Were you present at their interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was in the little room that leads off the
study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that room used for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to store books.&nbsp; It is completely lined with
shelves that are full of books.&nbsp; I was engaged dusting
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard someone enter the study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you overhear the conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while they spoke in ordinary tones; only when they
raised their voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you recognise the visitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was Mr. Thoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at Thoyne, who had started from his seat as if with
intention to intervene, then resumed it again as one who had
thought better of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they&mdash;was it a friendly interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;they disagreed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; Thoyne cried
explosively, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you desire to give evidence later&mdash;&rdquo; the
coroner began suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to give evidence&mdash;I have none to
give,&rdquo; Thoyne cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;This interview which was
purely private, took place hours before the&mdash;the tragedy,
and had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;Please be silent, Mr. Thoyne,&rdquo; the coroner
said a little sharply, &ldquo;and allow me to conduct the inquiry
in my own way.&nbsp; You shall, if you desire, have an
opportunity later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned again to Mrs. Halfleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that Sir Philip and Mr. Thoyne
disagreed&mdash;did you learn the cause of the&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought Thoyne once again to his feet and I did not
wonder at it.&nbsp; The coroner had evidently his own particular
method of conducting an inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once again I protest, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; he said, his
face flushed darkly with anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;This was a purely
private conversation and had nothing to do with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner took absolutely no notice of him this time but
simply repeated his question to Mrs. Halfleet though in a
slightly different form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you gather over what it was that Mr. Thoyne and Sir
Philip Clevedon&mdash;quarrelled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no quarrel,&rdquo; Thoyne interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was over&mdash;a lady,&rdquo; Mrs. Halfleet
responded slowly.</p>
<p>I began now to see something of the drift of this apparently
irregular questioning.&nbsp; There was more behind it all than
appeared to the casual observer.&nbsp; I glanced almost furtively
at Miss Kitty Clevedon but found her perfectly <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>calm and
tranquil though her face was dead white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the lady&rsquo;s name mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the coroner did not appear to be
disappointed by that reply and it also had the effect of
quietening Ronald Thoyne.&nbsp; His lips moved in a quick smile
and he settled himself back in his chair with an air of obvious
satisfaction.&nbsp; What they might say about himself apparently
did not worry him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear what they said when they raised their
voices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Sir Philip say, &lsquo;You are talking
nonsense.&nbsp; I cannot compel her to marry me against her
will.&nbsp; The decision rests with her.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was not
exactly shouting but was speaking a little more loudly than
usual.&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne seemed angry.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must
release her from her promise,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; His voice was
hoarse and he struck the table with his stick as he spoke.&nbsp;
I think Sir Philip stood up from his seat then.&nbsp; I did not
see him, of course, but I seemed to hear him walking up and
down.&nbsp; And he spoke sharply, almost angrily.&nbsp; The words
appeared to come with a sort of snap.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have nothing
to say in this matter,&rsquo; Sir Philip declared.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
neither hold her to her promise <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>nor release her from it.&nbsp; The
decision rests solely with her.&nbsp; If she notifies me that she
cannot marry me I have no power to compel her.&nbsp; But I am not
prepared to take your word for it.&nbsp; The decision must come
from herself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne said &lsquo;That is your
last word, is it?&rsquo; to which Sir Philip replied, &lsquo;My
first word and my last.&nbsp; As far as I am concerned I am
engaged and remain engaged until the young lady herself notifies
me that the engagement is at an end.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Mr. Thoyne
said, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t release her I shall find a way of
making you&mdash;I shall find a way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon which,&rdquo; Thoyne rapped out sarcastically,
&ldquo;I poisoned him with prussic acid.&nbsp; It certainly was
an effective form of compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried a police officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Thoyne echoed irascibly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a time for silence, isn&rsquo;t it, when I am
virtually accused of murdering Sir Philip Clevedon?&nbsp; This
lady has a marvellous memory, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have an opportunity of giving evidence and of
denying&mdash;&rdquo; the coroner began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am denying nothing,&rdquo; Thoyne interrupted half
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The story is all right as far as it
goes.&nbsp; Sir Philip Clevedon probably stood nearer a thrashing
than ever in his life before.&nbsp; <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>But I didn&rsquo;t poison him nor
did I stab him with a hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I happened just then to glance casually at Pepster, who was
seated a little behind the coroner and who was watching Thoyne
with a keen, intent gaze as if anxious not to miss the smallest
trifle of word or gesture.&nbsp; I began to read some method into
this curiously unconventional inquest episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo; the coroner asked,
turning to Mrs. Halfleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thoyne went out of the room banging the door behind
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true, Mr. Coroner,&rdquo; Thoyne cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I went home&mdash;to get the prussic acid.&nbsp; I had
forgotten to take it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner took no notice but turned to Mrs. Halfleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you heard anything previously of Sir Philip&rsquo;s
engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had not heard his name coupled with that of any
lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a whisper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halfleet was asked a number of further questions, chiefly
regarding household arrangements and with special regard to
glasses and bottles.&nbsp; But she added nothing to the <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>information
already set forth.&nbsp; And it all appeared very tame after the
Thoyne sensation.&nbsp; As she left the witness&rsquo;s chair,
Ronald Thoyne sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to call me, Mr. Coroner?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the coroner, &ldquo;I have nothing
to ask you.&nbsp; Do you desire to tender any
evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the coroner suavely,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have Lady Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady took her seat in the chair and sat bending a
little forward, her hands on her knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your hatpin, Lady Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you identify it as your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already told you it is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how it got to White Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean did I go and stab&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean that, Lady Clevedon.&nbsp; I asked you a
very simple question.&nbsp; Do you know how that hatpin got to
White Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lend it to anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are sure it is your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;For the third time&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any special mark on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know of any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be other pins like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another like it in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew the late Sir Philip Clevedon well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were good friends with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody was good friends for long with Philip
Clevedon.&nbsp; He was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled herself up, pursing her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something one ought not to say of a man who is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he any enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, but not of the murdering sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you heard of his engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not confide in me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had not heard of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I happened to glance at Pepster and saw him gazing as
intently at Lady Clevedon as he had done at Thoyne.&nbsp; For the
most part he had sat listening to the evidence with partly closed
eyes, as if it were very little concern of his.&nbsp; Only with
Ronald Thoyne and now with Lady Clevedon had he seemed at all
keenly <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>interested.&nbsp; Evidently there was more in Sir
Philip&rsquo;s mysterious engagement&mdash;known apparently to
Thoyne, but not to Sir Philip&rsquo;s own relatives&mdash;than
had appeared.&nbsp; The coroner glanced sideways at Pepster, who
nodded his head slightly as if answering an unspoken question in
the affirmative, upon which the coroner thanked Lady Clevedon for
her evidence and dismissed her.</p>

105</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
WHAT KITTY CLEVEDON SAID</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next witness was Miss Kitty
Clevedon herself and I confess I awaited her coming with more
than ordinary interest.&nbsp; Of one thing I was certain, that
she would say exactly what she wanted to say and not a word more,
and that no intrusive scruples would confine her too urgently to
the truth, unless, indeed, the fact that she was on oath might
have any influence with her, which I doubted.&nbsp; I have always
found that a woman&rsquo;s conscience is in that respect far more
elastic than a man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She took her seat in the
witness&rsquo;s chair and glanced round her with thoughtful calm,
nor was her tranquillity in the least abated when she saw me
watching her.&nbsp; There was certainly not the faintest
suggestion in her manner that my presence disturbed her in the
slightest, or, indeed that she had ever so much as seen me
before.&nbsp; The coroner took up the hatpin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen this before?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;Many times.&nbsp; It belongs to Lady
Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever borrowed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you wear it when you visited Mrs. Halfleet on the
day&mdash;er&mdash;the day of Sir Philip
Clevedon&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;decease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly detail the circumstances of your visit
to White Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clevedon asked me to convey a message to Mrs.
Halfleet regarding some parish business, the clothing club at the
church of which Lady Clevedon is president and Mrs. Halfleet is
secretary.&nbsp; On my way I was caught in the rain and my hat
was soaked through. Mrs. Halfleet advised me to dry it at the
fire in her room and I did so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you were caught in the rain&mdash;did you walk
to White Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I went in my own motor, a little two-seater which I
drive myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no one with you in the car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used this hatpin to secure your hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course took it out when you
removed&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;What happened to the hatpin when you resumed
your hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you wear that hat without a pin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I frequently did.&nbsp; Sometimes I use a
hatpin and sometimes not.&nbsp; That particular hat fits very
close and I pull it well down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I want you to be very careful in answering the next
few questions as they are exceptionally important.&nbsp; You are
sure you had the hatpin when you visited Mrs.
Halfleet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that was because I don&rsquo;t see how else it
could get here.&nbsp; The use of a hatpin is more or less
mechanical, you know, and sometimes I wear one and sometimes I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I think I brought it here but I cannot
remember either putting it in my hat or taking it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not swear then that you had it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor that I hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I cannot
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hopeless, then, to ask you where you laid it
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, I am afraid.&nbsp; If I had it with me I should
take it out without thinking and lay it down anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;Where were you standing when you took your hat
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might possibly lay the hatpin on the
mantelpiece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that a very likely place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot recollect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot remember anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did you remain with Mrs. Halfleet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about half an hour, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was the cap during that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the fender drying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it dry when you took it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drier than it was, but still damp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you put it on again, can you remember whether you
used the hatpin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot remember for certain, but apparently I did
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you suggest any reason why you should want a hatpin
when you left Hapforth House, but did without one when you were
going from White Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you again remove the hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I reached home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the absence of the hatpin strike you
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t think of it.&nbsp; I could
not even say for certain that it was absent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner sat for a moment or two drawing figures on his
blotting-paper, then turned suddenly towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go out again that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Miss Kitty Clevedon looked casually round, our glances met
and for a brief second her eyes held mine, hardly in questioning,
certainly not in fear, but with some subtle suggestion I could
not then interpret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with inimitable composure, &ldquo;I
did not go out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That might have been perfectly true since it was at least
possible that she had not gone straight from White Towers to
Hapforth House.&nbsp; Though it was hardly possible she could
have been absent all the evening without some remark.&nbsp; If,
on the other hand, she was lying, and I had good reason for
knowing that she possessed all the qualities essential to success
in that very difficult art, then her midnight expedition had been
secret.&nbsp; It was a tangle that would have to be straightened
out later, and so far, I hadn&rsquo;t either end of the string in
my fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Sir Philip Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I went to his study, but he was not there and I did
not wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>That
is all the evidence it is necessary for me to detail here, nor
need I reproduce the address of the coroner, who carefully
examined in his summing-up the possibilities of suicide, and
rather discounted them.</p>
<p>The jury retired into the study&mdash;the room in which Sir
Philip&rsquo;s dead body had been found&mdash;to consider their
verdict.&nbsp; It was not quite such a simple matter as one might
suppose.&nbsp; My fellow jurymen were deeply impressed with the
heavy responsibility thrust upon them, quite unnecessarily so,
since a coroner&rsquo;s verdict does not matter a snap of the
finger one way or the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gents all,&rdquo; said Tim Dallott, our foreman,
&ldquo;the question is&mdash;suicide or murder?&nbsp; Why should
he want to commit suicide?&nbsp; And if he did, where did he hide
the bottle?&nbsp; You, Mester Hapton&rdquo;&mdash;this to a big,
heavy man with a vast head, a considerable farmer in the
Dale&mdash;&ldquo;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hapton slowly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to know one way or the
other,&rdquo; Tim Dallott cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know as I have,&rdquo; was the
deliberate reply.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll say murder, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not so sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but then, you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it wasn&rsquo;t suicide, it was murder, and if
it wasn&rsquo;t murder it was suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Hapton cried,
brightening up a little.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was the next to be interrogated, and I snapped
out my answer even before our foreman had completed his
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Murder, undoubtedly,&rdquo; I said, not
because I had really any such certainty, or had made up my mind
on the matter, but in order to get the thing settled.&nbsp; My
very unrural promptitude gave the cue to the rest, and
&ldquo;murder&rdquo; went round with affecting unanimity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mester Hapton,&rdquo; Tim Dallott added,
&ldquo;everybody but you&rsquo;s said murder&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
not stand out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one to be contrary-like,&rdquo; Mr.
Hapton said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But murder&mdash;it&rsquo;s an ugly
business, that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter very much,&rdquo; I
interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to hang anybody
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor not to mention no names,&rdquo; our foreman put
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Persons or person unknown&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Mr. Hapton said, with a gloomy
shake of the head, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re all set on murder,
murder let it be, but it&rsquo;s an ugly word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was our verdict&mdash;&ldquo;Murder by some person or
persons unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, for my part, like Mr. Hapton,
I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure.&nbsp; And, curiously enough, the
hatpin was not so much as mentioned.</p>
<p>It was the day following the inquest that I met Detective
Pepster in the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, good morning, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; Pepster cried, as I
joined him.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is Cartordale using you these
times?&nbsp; Have you settled down amongst us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;This place
rather improves on acquaintance.&nbsp; I think I would like to
see a summer here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right in the summer, if the summer
is all right,&rdquo; Pepster rejoined dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But our
summer isn&rsquo;t much to rave over.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t last
long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; And how is the mystery
getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery?&rdquo; Pepster echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
you mean the murder.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t getting on.&nbsp; I was
just coming along to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see me!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to arrest you,&rdquo; he <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>returned,
with a soft chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not at all.&nbsp; But do
you know Kelham, of Scotland Yard?&nbsp; I had a letter from him
to-day.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dennis Holt is living in your
neighbourhood,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask him who murdered
Clevedon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, what does he mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kelham&mdash;yes, I know Kelham very well,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a humorist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish he&rsquo;d let me in on the joke,
anyway,&rdquo; Pepster said discontentedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
know who murdered Sir Philip Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not yet.&nbsp; For that
matter, I don&rsquo;t even know that he was murdered.&nbsp; But I
shall find out, and then I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you belong to the Force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes disguised,&rdquo; I said with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Anyway, Kelham is no
fool.&nbsp; Why not take his advice and let me come in?&nbsp; Not
that you can keep me out, but it&rsquo;s easier.&nbsp; I am not a
detective, not at all, but merely a writer of books.&nbsp; Still,
I have discovered a few little things that have been useful to
the police and especially to Kelham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure you will know who&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am quite sure
I shall know eventually.&nbsp; But whether the <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>knowledge
will be of any use to you is another matter.&nbsp; I only solve
the mystery, but you have to prove the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pepster said thoughtfully, &ldquo;and that
is a different thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I may have a good
idea who did it, but where is my proof?&nbsp; But as to letting
you in, it seems I can&rsquo;t help myself.&nbsp; I showed
Kelham&rsquo;s letter to the Chief Constable this morning.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dennis Holt?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he at
Cartordale?&nbsp; Did he come down especially for
this?&rsquo;&nbsp; I told him, no, that you&rsquo;d been living
here and that you&rsquo;d been on the jury.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go and
see him,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Talk it over with
him.&nbsp; Tell him everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; And there you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
make the same bargain with you I did with Kelham and his
crowd.&nbsp; What I discover I will pass on, but I don&rsquo;t
appear in it publicly.&nbsp; Do we work together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, certainly,&rdquo; Pepster said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Since both Kelham and the Chief insist on it I should be a
fool to stand out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We strode along in silence for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Pepster remarked, &ldquo;there are a
few matters that haven&rsquo;t&mdash;come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There always are,&rdquo; I replied, thinking of Kitty
Clevedon&rsquo;s midnight visit regarding <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>which, at
present, at all events, I intended to say nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, that valet, John Tulmin,&rdquo; Pepster
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should Sir Philip Clevedon have given
him a cheque for &pound;500 the day before he was&mdash;before he
died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly hasn&rsquo;t come out.&nbsp; Did
he?&nbsp; And did Tulmin cash it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there was no particular secret about it.&nbsp;
The counterfoil of the cheque-book seemed quite plain,
&lsquo;John Tulmin, &pound;500,&rsquo; and the money was paid out
to Tulmin by the bank in Midlington at 11.30 on the morning of
the day Sir Philip was&mdash;died.&nbsp; The bank knew Tulmin
well.&nbsp; He had often transacted business for Sir
Philip.&nbsp; Now, suppose that cheque was a forgery, or suppose
it had been made out for &pound;5 and Tulmin altered it to
&pound;500, or suppose the money was really for household
expenses, and Tulmin stuck to it and Clevedon discovered it or
Tulmin feared discovery, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be your motive, certainly,&rdquo; I
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has Tulmin explained the cheque?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not in detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it was money owing him.&nbsp; &lsquo;What about
this cheque?&rsquo; I asked him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, the governor
owed me that,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; But when I wanted something a
bit more definite be dried up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other cheques of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I might
inquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tulmin&rsquo;s salary was paid
monthly&mdash;&pound;20 a month.&nbsp; This is an
extra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he declares it is money owing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it was,&rdquo; I said, as we drew up
outside the little post office where I had to make a call.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think I would arrest Tulmin just
yet.&nbsp; Tell the Chief you have that from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what I wanted to know more than anything just then was why
John Tulmin was blackmailing Sir Philip Clevedon.</p>
<h2><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>CHAPTER X<br />
AN INVITATION FROM LADY CLEVEDON</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; cried
the young lady behind the counter of the little general shop that
was also the village post office.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have just taken
a telegram for you.&nbsp; You can have it now if you like.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s against the regulations, but that doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the yellow slip and perused the message which was from
a publishing firm with whom I was negotiating, offering me a
price for a manuscript I had submitted to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lot of money,&rdquo; the girl said, with a
touch of envy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would take me years and years to
earn that at this job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be here years and years,&rdquo; I
replied smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some lucky man will snap you up
long before that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no queue so far,&rdquo; the girl
returned dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps when Mr. Holt has quite finished, other
customers may have a turn,&rdquo; said a mocking <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>voice at my
elbow, and wheeling round with a quick movement that dislodged a
pile of picture post cards and albums and brought them clattering
to the floor, I saw Kitty Clevedon&rsquo;s face flushed with
pretty colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
just reading a telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been down to Stone Hollow,&rdquo; Kitty Clevedon
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, I have been looking for you.&nbsp;
I have a message for you from Lady Clevedon.&nbsp; She would like
you to come and see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&nbsp; When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, could you come now?&nbsp; I have my car
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded assent, and followed her out of the shop to the smart
little two-seater, which she managed with a skill that betokened
plentiful practice.&nbsp; As we drove off I saw Pepster walking
slowly through the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that man,&rdquo; Kitty said, as
Pepster saluted, &ldquo;but I have seen him about quite a lot
lately.&nbsp; And he was at the&mdash;the inquest.&nbsp; I
suppose he belongs to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a detective.&nbsp; He is very interested in
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are a very interesting person,&rdquo;
Kitty rejoined equably.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I am under
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to have another look at Pepster, and the car
swerved suddenly to the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady on!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have us into the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I do not understand.&nbsp; Why should
they&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the story is very simple.&nbsp; The police knew I
was out late on that particular night. Sergeant Gamley saw
me.&nbsp; They questioned me, of course, and after all, it was a
trifle&mdash;er&mdash;suspicious-looking, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
Here was I, a new-comer and a stranger, wandering about the Dale
at midnight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused and glanced at her to note the effect of my words;
and was interested to see that she had grown perceptibly
paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&mdash;surely they didn&rsquo;t suspect
you?&rdquo; she said, in tones that were very little above a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I returned cheerfully,
&ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t they suspect me?&nbsp; They know
nothing about me, and certainly nothing that would count
particularly in my favour.&nbsp; At all events, they questioned
me.&nbsp; Had I seen anyone that night?&nbsp; And I lied to
them.&nbsp; I had seen nobody at all.&nbsp; There are occasions,
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>you
know, when mendacity may be condoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty gazed at me with wide-open eyes for fully a minute, then
pulled herself together with an effort and laughed with a quite
passable imitation of merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had you seen anyone?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, smiling into her face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had seen a very beautiful and clever woman and an
extremely capable actress whose ideas regarding truth are
apparently nearly as flexible as my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed a little, but remained apparently undisturbed by
either the compliment or the sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which had committed the crime?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it the beautiful and clever
woman&mdash;you said beautiful and clever, didn&rsquo;t
you?&mdash;or the capable actress?&nbsp; But still, I don&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; I thought you were a great detective&mdash;a
sort of Sherlock Holmes in real life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw myself back on the cushioned seat with a quick
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that fairy story from?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it&rsquo;s true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not a detective,
certainly <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>not.&nbsp; And I am not a great anything, unless it be
a great liar.&nbsp; I have had a little practice at that just
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is why auntie has sent for you,&rdquo; she
added, with a puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am a great liar?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, quite seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because you&mdash;because she thinks that
you&mdash;somebody told her you were a great
detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and why does she need the services of
a&mdash;er&mdash;a detective?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants you to find out who murdered Sir Philip
Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; And do <i>you</i> want me to discover
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but I don&rsquo;t think you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you thought I could, you wouldn&rsquo;t want me to
try&mdash;is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, I don&rsquo;t know what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave all her attention to the car after that, while I,
having nothing particular to say, lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>We found Lady Clevedon seated in the small parlour, a square,
cheerful room, furnished evidently for comfort with couches and
big arm-chairs.&nbsp; The old lady bade me sit down and then
plunged with characteristic abruptness into the subject of the
interview.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;What is your fee?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fee?&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have no
fee.&nbsp; I am neither a doctor nor a solicitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor a parson&mdash;you may as well complete the usual
trio,&rdquo; the old lady said dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you are a
policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was so unexpected that I could not forbear a soft
laugh in which, after a momentary hesitation, Miss Kitty Clevedon
joined me.&nbsp; I expected her to label me detective; that she
should call me policeman had all the elements of novelty that go
to make up unconscious humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But policemen are not allowed to take fees,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have their salaries&mdash;or is it
wages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you get a salary?&rdquo; Lady Clevedon demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but then you see I am not a policeman; I am merely
a writer of books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Chief Constable of Peakborough&mdash;he is a cousin
of mine, distant, but still a cousin, and a fool at that, or he
would have found out before this who killed Sir Philip&mdash;told
me you were a celebrated detective and that if I could get your
help&mdash;now, who did murder Sir Philip Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; I asked, rudely enough I admit <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>though the
question was well in accord with her own conversational
style.&nbsp; Nor did she take it amiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; No,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I
murder him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you are quite sure of that,&rdquo; I returned,
&ldquo;you have all the world to go at.&nbsp; I may have done it,
or Miss Clevedon may have done it, or Tulmin
may&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May, may, may&mdash;you tire me to death with your
may&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to know who may have done
it, but who did.&nbsp; I suppose it is a case of the needle in
the haystack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the needle in the haystack could be found, given
the necessary time and labour,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would talk sense,&rdquo; the old lady
rejoined tartly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have had that fat man Peppermint,
Peppercorn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepster,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have had him here and pumped him
hard.&nbsp; But he knows nothing, merely talks in a squeaky voice
and gets nowhere.&nbsp; Now, how would you start discovering
who&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found the old lady interesting and decided to humour her,
not because I intended to be of any use to her, but because it
was just possible she might be useful to me.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied slowly, &ldquo;there are
several starting points.&nbsp; For example, who benefits most by
his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I happened to glance just then at Miss Kitty Clevedon and
noticed that her face had gone an almost chalky whiteness that
extended even to her lips and that she was gripping the arm of
her chair with a strong, nervous tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; I went on slowly, keeping my voice
low and tranquil as if it were really a matter of small
importance, &ldquo;who is Sir Philip&rsquo;s heir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I still kept my eyes on Kitty Clevedon and noted that her
grip on the chair tightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t do it, anyway,&rdquo; Lady
Clevedon retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose he did,&rdquo; I returned,
carefully refraining from raising my voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I merely
said that he would be my starting point.&nbsp; Then, doubtless,
he would prove an alibi and I should eliminate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy might have hit him over the head with a
stick,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon went on, &ldquo;but he wouldn&rsquo;t
poison a man nor would he dig a hatpin into him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you never know,&rdquo; I replied cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;Sir William Clevedon&mdash;the new
baronet&mdash;Kitty&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; the old lady
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he never poisoned Philip.&nbsp; They
weren&rsquo;t friends, certainly, but then, Philip had no
friends.&nbsp; And they had quarrelled; though for that matter
Philip had quarrelled with Ronald Thoyne, as you heard at the
inquest.&nbsp; Philip was that way.&nbsp; He quarrelled with most
people.&nbsp; But Billy didn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; He is with his
regiment in Ireland, trying to keep the Sinn Feiners
quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is his alibi which rules him out,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>But I made up my mind to learn more regarding Billy
Clevedon.&nbsp; His sister&rsquo;s agitation had been too
pronounced to be disregarded; and it was the more impressive in
that I knew her for a very clever actress with a singular
capacity for holding her own and keeping a straight face.</p>
<p>What was it, I wondered, that had so completely upset her and
smashed down all her defences.&nbsp; It did not take me long to
decide that.&nbsp; She had been told that I was &ldquo;a great
detective&rdquo; who would infallibly discover the murderer and
practically my first observation had been a direct hint that her
brother might be the man.&nbsp; A suggestion so libellous should
have caused her to flame out in resentment and denial instead of
which she had had to exert all her <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>strength and will-power to keep
herself from fainting.&nbsp; There was more in all this than one
could sum up in a moment or two and I made up my mind then and
there that Billy would become an object of great interest to
me.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to learn all I wanted.&nbsp; The fact
that most people referred to him as Billy Clevedon and that no
one called him Sir William may indicate something of his general
personality, though that would be to do him some injustice since
the diminutive was partly born of affection and was partly a
survival from bygone years.&nbsp; There were those who declared
that his sister had been mainly responsible for the reputation
Billy had enjoyed for juvenile mischief.&nbsp; I could well
believe that, knowing her in maturer years.&nbsp; She would lead
him on and he, being a little gentleman, would bear the
blame.</p>
<p>But that after all is only the female way.&nbsp; Man was
intended by Nature to carry every burden save one and that the
heaviest of the lot.&nbsp; From my housekeeper to whom I first
applied I learnt little.&nbsp; She had heard stories but had
never known Billy Clevedon personally.&nbsp; I applied to both
Dr. Crawford and the Vicar, but with hardly more success.&nbsp;
They, too, had the usual legends off by heart, but Billy had <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>never been
ill and had no reputation for piety and seemed to have kept out
of the way of both doctor and parson.&nbsp; Tim Dallott could
tell me a little more but it consisted chiefly of reminiscences
of Sunday rat-hunts and fishing.&nbsp; Among them all, however, I
built up a picture of a freckled, yellow-haired lad, full of high
spirits and mischief, but honest and never afraid to face
punishment for what he had done.&nbsp; And somewhere, not far
away, hovered incessantly the figure of his sister, as
irrepressible as himself but far more adroit.</p>
<p>But all that was years ago when they came as orphans to live
at White Towers, when Lady Clevedon&rsquo;s husband was alive and
before the late Sir Philip had succeeded to the title.&nbsp; In
due time they both went away to school and Cartordale knew them
only in the holidays.&nbsp; They were but shadows of their former
selves as far as their general activities went, or possibly were
more careful and clever at evading the results.</p>
<p>Eventually Billy Clevedon went into the army, but as a career,
not merely as a war measure, and won some distinctions in
France.&nbsp; But he justified his old-time reputation in that he
remained apparently a somewhat incalculable quantity always doing
the unexpected.&nbsp; His <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>sister, having finished her
education with more or less credit, accompanied her aunt to
Hapforth House and settled there, though during the war she
engaged in various occupations and learnt to drive a motor, milk
cows, and use a typewriter.</p>

129</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
A VISIT FROM RONALD THOYNE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &ldquo;Waggon and Horses&rdquo;
in Cartordale was one of the best known inns in the district,
with a history behind it that went far beyond the printed word
into the mists and myths of legend and tradition.&nbsp; I
believe, in fact, that it possessed its own duly authenticated
ghost, that of a sailor on tramp towards the coast, who had been
murdered for his gold by a rascally landlord and his wife.&nbsp;
This was well over two centuries ago and it was a long time now
since the sailor&rsquo;s restless spirit had been seen.&nbsp; But
the records of its appearances were definite and were at all
events implicitly believed in by the Dale folk.</p>
<p>The inn was a favourite visiting place of holiday-makers from
Midlington and on a fine Saturday afternoon or Sunday in the
summer one might see sixty or seventy vehicles lined up in the
wide open space before the entrance, while their passengers
refreshed themselves within.</p>
<p>Tim Dallott, the landlord, was well known <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>throughout
the Dale and was highly esteemed.&nbsp; The new-fangled notion
that an innkeeper is a sort of semi-criminal had no countenance
in Cartordale, where they liked their ale and took it
strong&mdash;as strong, that is, as a grandmotherly Control Board
would allow them to have it.</p>
<p>And, whatever else Tim Dallott was, he was a judge of ale and
would have only the best.&nbsp; Being an observer of my
fellow-man, I had early made Tim&rsquo;s acquaintance and had
spent more than one interesting hour with him and his
customers.</p>
<p>Tim, himself, was a masterful man, rather given to laying down
the law, though with an occasional touch of humour that leavened
his bluntness; and he had a curious habit of screwing the
forefinger of his right hand into the open palm of his left when
he was saying anything particularly emphatic.&nbsp; His build was
inclined to stoutness and he was very bald for all he was still
some years off sixty.&nbsp; His wife had died just before the war
and he had neither son nor daughter.&nbsp; It was he, the reader
will recollect, who had been foreman of the jury at the Clevedon
inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as I entered the
&lsquo;snug,&rsquo; &ldquo;and what do you think of it all?&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t seen you since the inquest, Mr. Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;Give me a glass of beer,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; chimed in old
Tompkinson, who was verger at the parish church and gardener at
the vicarage, &ldquo;is why old Crimin&rdquo;&mdash;have I
explained that Crimin was the coroner?&mdash;&ldquo;worried about
that whisky bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, you may say that,&rdquo; Tim agreed, nodding his
head with an air of vague mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed main foolish to me,&rdquo; Tompkinson went
on, &ldquo;and I couldn&rsquo;t get a grip of it nohow.&nbsp;
Nobbut Crimin is a good crowner, I&rsquo;m saying nowt agin him,
an&rsquo; I dessay he&rsquo;d summat oop his sleeve an&rsquo;
all, but I&rsquo;m fair bothered as to what it could
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bothering better men than you, Joe
Tompkinson,&rdquo; Tim Dallott said dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t you got no idea, Mr. Dallott?&rdquo;
Joe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have and perhaps I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was
the cautious reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now what would you say about it,
Mr. Holt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little, shrivelled old man, who had been seated in a corner
by the fire, sipping occasionally at a glass of hot rum,
interposed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the gal they quarrelled over?&rdquo; he
demanded in a shrill, piping treble.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know who it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Then if I were you I&rsquo;d keep it to myself,
Jonathan Crossty,&rdquo; Tim said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
names&mdash;think what you like but don&rsquo;t say it out
loud&mdash;that&rsquo;s safest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan nodded as if in agreement and returned once more to
his hot rum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that whisky bottle,&rdquo; Joe Tompkinson resumed,
&ldquo;how could any man tell it was the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;Taint
in sense, is it?&nbsp; Then why worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A youth came briskly in and asked for a glass of stout.&nbsp;
He caught Joe&rsquo;s last remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s more than
one theory will fit that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You newspaper gentlemen are wonderful fond of
theories,&rdquo; Tim Dallott responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your papers
would be none the worse if you were a bit fonder of
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth laughed good-humouredly and took a long drink at his
stout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as he set his glass down again,
&ldquo;suppose that X&mdash;we&rsquo;ll not mention names, the
libel laws being what they are&mdash;wanted to poison Z.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bring me a whisky and soda,&rsquo; says Z.&nbsp; And X, as
he brings the bottle, drops a dose of prussic acid in it.&nbsp;
Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nowt good in that,&rdquo; Joe Tompkinson
interrupted.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;You should skin your eyes, then,&rdquo; Tim
Dallott retorted brusquely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good enough, anyway,&rdquo; the
pressman went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Z drinks his whisky and falls
down dead.&nbsp; Then X creeps in, takes away the doped bottle,
and smashes it, and puts another of the same brand in its
place.&nbsp; Could anyone tell that the bottle had been
changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning by Z, Sir Philip Clevedon,&rdquo; Joe
interposed, &ldquo;and by X&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to mention no names,&rdquo; Tim
interrupted angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re intent on
dragging folk in by name go and do it outside and not in this
snug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence meant,&rdquo; Joe replied meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no names, and stick to that,&rdquo; Tim
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s another way,&rdquo; the pressman went
on oracularly, obviously in love with the sound of his own voice
and delighted with the impression he was making.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s suppose that X gives Z a drink of whisky at
dinner and then puts the bottle on the sideboard.&nbsp; Presently
Y creeps in and drops the dope into the whisky and then, when Z
has pegged out, comes back and changes the bottles&mdash;how
about that?&nbsp; Y would be somebody who had a grudge against
Z&mdash;perhaps he had had a quarrel with him.&nbsp; But <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the point
is here&mdash;nobody can swear it was the same bottle, that
stands to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not print either of these theories in your
paper, I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar,&rdquo; Tim Dallott said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, and perhaps not,&rdquo; the youth returned
vaguely.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the editor&rsquo;s job, not
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the gal they quarrelled over,&rdquo; Jonathan
Crossty chimed in suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who quarrelled over?&rdquo; demanded the youth,
wheeling round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean I won&rsquo;t have any names in this
snug,&rdquo; Tim interrupted angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I
keep saying it?&nbsp; What a lot of cross-grained, gossiping old
hags it is.&nbsp; X&rsquo;s and Z&rsquo;s are all right, but not
names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that came out in evidence&mdash;that they&rsquo;d
quarrelled,&rdquo; the reporter said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s name didn&rsquo;t, and it might be
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know who it is,&rdquo; Jonathan persisted.</p>
<p>I finished my drink and nodding a good night all round took
myself off, but not very far because I waited in the shadows
until old Jonathan Crossty came hobbling out.&nbsp; I met him in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not home yet, Mr.
Crossty?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I
swung round and we went down the road together.&nbsp; He lived in
a little cottage nearly opposite Stone Hollow, and it was thus
quite natural that we should be going the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you know the lady they quarrelled over,&rdquo; I
remarked, after a few preliminary observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
telling.&nbsp; My grand-darter&rsquo;s &rsquo;tween maid at
Hapforth and she knows all about it.&nbsp; They quarrelled over
her right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over your grand-daughter?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over Lucy!&rdquo; he said scornfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a big fule, mister.&nbsp; Why should they
quarrel over Lucy?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good girl and she&rsquo;s
only sixteen.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you go for to mix her up in this
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; Lucy,
who&rsquo;s as good as she&rsquo;s pretty and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, she&rsquo;s nowt to look at,&rdquo; the old man
said, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Lucy told you that both Sir Philip and Mr.
Thoyne were in love with Miss Kitty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never said nowt o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sooart,&rdquo;
the old man retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of her
business, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I agreed.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>I
changed the subject after that and we discoursed on various
matters of no great interest to either of us until we parted at
the gate of Stone Hollow.</p>
<p>Later, when I had dined comfortably and well, and was seated
in my study smoking a cigar, Mrs. Helter, my housekeeper entered
with the information that Mr. Thoyne had called and wished to see
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he will not keep you long,&rdquo; Mrs. Helter
explained, &ldquo;and his business is not immediately pressing if
you are otherwise engaged.&nbsp; But, if not, he says it would be
convenient if you could see him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thoyne,&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,
that&rsquo;s rather funny.&nbsp; But show him in,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald Thoyne entered the room a moment or two later, a large,
rather lumbering figure in appearance but moving with a curiously
alert lightness.&nbsp; His bulk signified strength, not
fat.&nbsp; I rose and greeted him, then returned to my own
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will wonder why I have come,&rdquo; Thoyne began,
as he took the seat indicated and selected a cigarette from the
box I offered him.&nbsp; Apparently, he wanted to maintain at
least an appearance of friendship.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, thanks,
I&rsquo;ll have nothing to drink,&rdquo; he added, as I motioned
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>towards
the whisky on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, now, as to the reason
for coming, well, in the first place, I have wanted to make your
acquaintance.&nbsp; The fact that you are a near neighbour
renders you&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;an object of interest.&nbsp;
No, do not smile.&nbsp; If that had been all I should have
waited.&nbsp; There is something else, but we shall come to that
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, but offered no comment on these obviously
preliminary observations.&nbsp; I was quite well aware that this
was no mere friendly call&mdash;that Thoyne had some very
definite purpose in his mind&mdash;and I was quite content to
wait until it should suit him to disclose it.&nbsp; Thoyne,
probably, had expected some sort of a reply, something that
would, so to speak, open a conversation and for a moment or two
he paused.&nbsp; But he did not allow my calculated silence to
disconcert him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; Thoyne began again, &ldquo;that my
manner may seem a little abrupt to you, Mr. Holt, but I always go
straight to the point.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have been more
tactful if I&rsquo;d talked a bit first&mdash;yes.&nbsp; I have
noticed that the people of these old countries like to go round
and round the mulberry bush before they come to the point, but
that is not our way&mdash;no, sir.&nbsp; I had a lesson on that
from old Silas <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Pegler when I was a very young man.&nbsp; He was
president of the Trans-Central and scores of other big things and
he pulled all sorts of wires.&nbsp; I had to see him once about a
deal and I began: &lsquo;Good morning, Mr. Pegler, a fine
morning, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&nbsp; But he only wrinkled his
ugly old face and glared at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;I am here to talk dollars, not weather.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And since then I have cultivated the habit of straight
talk.&nbsp; It pays in New York but not so well in this
country.&nbsp; A lot of people write me down as bad form and a
man over here who is once labelled bad form had far better be
dead and buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay back in my chair and regarded my visitor
smilingly.&nbsp; Certainly for a person who cultivated a habit of
straight talk, he was singularly discursive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you intending to remain in Cartordale?&rdquo;
Thoyne asked, seeing that I remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be here for a little while yet, though I cannot
say that I have made any definite plans,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean as a permanent resident.&nbsp; You see,
somebody, I think it was Dr. Crawford told me&mdash;hinted that
you&mdash;.&nbsp; Now, if you wanted to sell this house,
I&rsquo;d like to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>The
suggestion was so surprising that for a moment I had nothing to
say, but I recovered quickly, knowing that if there was an
explanation it would appear in due course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you prepared to offer for it?&rdquo; I
demanded cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since, apparently, you want the
house, you should be prepared to bid high for it.&nbsp; That
makes a difference, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; The seller who wants
to sell would take less than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Thoyne said
persuasively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it
but for Dr. Crawford.&nbsp; He gave me the idea.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish he were staying amongst us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid, he&rsquo;ll not be here long!&nbsp; A very
charming young&mdash;&rsquo; yes, those were his
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost photographic in their accuracy,&rdquo; I said
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he wants a customer for his
house&mdash;hankers after the fleshpots of London,&rsquo; said
the doctor.&nbsp; And I thought that perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did make some such
remark&mdash;casually,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Dr.
Crawford took it too seriously.&nbsp; This place improves on
acquaintance.&nbsp; No, on the whole, I don&rsquo;t think I want
to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us forget Dr. Crawford.&nbsp; I do not <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>want to
sell, therefore I must be tempted.&nbsp; It is your turn
now&mdash;to tempt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give you&mdash;four thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place isn&rsquo;t worth that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m willing to give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;it is yours.&nbsp; There is a charming
little cottage just by the church that I could get for six
hundred.&nbsp; It would suit me exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne frowned heavily and spoke as if choosing his words with
some care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should attach to my offer a condition&mdash;that you
leave Cartordale&mdash;and do not return.&nbsp; For that I would
make it five thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now we really are getting to the straight
talk,&rdquo; I said smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose we make it
absolutely straight.&nbsp; You want to get me out of
Cartordale&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne sat silent for the space of fully two minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight talk doesn&rsquo;t seem so easy as you
thought&mdash;is that it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
owe me some explanation surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The talk is straight enough,&rdquo; Thoyne responded
half sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to get you out of
Cartordale&mdash;yes, that is true, and I have told you so
frankly enough.&nbsp; What do my reasons matter?&nbsp; I am
willing to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>will be equally straight.&nbsp; I decline to go.&nbsp;
Did Miss Kitty Clevedon send you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she to do with it&mdash;or you with
her?&rdquo; he demanded angrily.</p>
<p>But I saw easily enough that my chance shot had hit the
mark.&nbsp; And I sat eyeing him thoughtfully for a moment or two
wondering how far it would be safe to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I said, speaking calmly, even
casually, as if it were a matter of no great moment, &ldquo;it
was over Miss Kitty Clevedon that you quarrelled with the late
baronet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right&mdash;&rdquo; he began explosively
but I pulled him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I have,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you see I am
retained, in a semi-professional capacity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That damned
old fool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning whom?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg her pardon,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I meant Lady Clevedon.&nbsp; Why did she want to drag you into
it?&nbsp; You have a reputation, haven&rsquo;t you, for solving
such puzzles as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some little,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
solve this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want it
solved.&nbsp; At least, I want to see it buried and
forgotten.&nbsp; The thing&rsquo;s a damned nightmare.&nbsp;
There, now <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>it&rsquo;s out.&nbsp; We want you to drop the
case&mdash;to go away and leave it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does Miss Clevedon
know of this visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she knows I am to try and persuade you to drop
the case.&nbsp; She asked me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for her sake you want me to leave it
alone,&rdquo; I commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not for
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&mdash;no&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t concern me,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;except as everything that interests her,
concerns me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t concern you?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet you were the last person known to have
quarrelled with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean to accuse me of the
murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I interrupted promptly,
&ldquo;but look at the sequence.&nbsp; You quarrel with Sir
Philip Clevedon and a few hours later he is dead.&nbsp; Then a
celebrated detective&mdash;that I am neither a detective nor
celebrated is only a detail&mdash;is put on the case and you try
to buy him off, to bribe him in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a complete case,&rdquo; he admitted, with a quick
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;the sort of completeness
that is too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he added, as the grin widened.&nbsp;
<a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>&ldquo;I
can already feel the rope round my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran his finger along the inside of his collar with a very
expressive gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; I went on, still speaking
with off-hand tranquillity, &ldquo;though you did not murder Sir
Philip Clevedon you think you know who did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew himself slowly up from the chair and stood over me
with a face that had gone curiously grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have in point of fact already begun my
inquiries,&rdquo; I went on, rising in my turn and looking him
straight in the eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t Sir William
Clevedon come to Cartordale to take up his title and
estate?&nbsp; He left his quarters in Ireland on the 19th, three
or four days before Sir Philip Clevedon died.&nbsp; He is still
absent from duty.&nbsp; You can learn a lot by well-placed
telegrams in a very short time.&nbsp; Where is he now?&nbsp;
Where was he on February 23rd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew now what Thoyne and Kitty Clevedon feared.&nbsp; He
stood glaring at me for a moment or two, then buttoned his coat
with fingers that trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I have done anybody much good by coming <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>here but it
seemed the quickest and straightest way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not offer his hand nor did he say another word, but
opened the door himself without waiting for my help and
disappeared.</p>

RONALD THOYNE DISAPPEARS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next move in this very curious
game was made by Pepster who called on me a few days after my
interview with Ronald Thoyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a warrant for Tulmin&rsquo;s arrest,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not surprised.&nbsp; I
could see you were edging that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right way.&nbsp; Tulmin has
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&nbsp; That is interesting at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he went from White Towers to Lennsdale&mdash;that
is Mr. Thoyne&rsquo;s house, you know.&nbsp; Thoyne engaged him
the day after the inquest and he went at once.&nbsp; And now he
has gone altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged him as what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as Clevedon&mdash;valet, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put someone on to watch him of course.&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t going to let him slip away.&nbsp; But he <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>has managed
it, at least so my man reports and he must be a damned fool, as I
told him.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t been seen for two
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your man hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean Tulmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoyne should know where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he doesn&rsquo;t but I haven&rsquo;t seen him
myself.&nbsp; I am going up to Lennsdale now to question
him.&nbsp; Would you care to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first I thought not, and then I altered my mind.&nbsp;
After all, Thoyne really was right in the thick of it.</p>
<p>When we reached Thoyne&rsquo;s house Pepster took the lead and
rang lustily at the bell, which was one of the old-fashioned type
with a long, hanging handle of cast-iron.&nbsp; He had to ring
three times before he obtained any response and then the door was
slowly opened to disclose a very old, white-headed man standing
blinking at us with watery eyes.&nbsp; To Pepster&rsquo;s
question as to whether Mr. Thoyne was at home he only shook his
head, but whether in negative reply or merely in stupidity we
could not quite make out.&nbsp; The old man&rsquo;s face at all
events was devoid of expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he is not at home?&rdquo; I demanded
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will see for ourselves,&rdquo; Pepster said, <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>pushing
past the old man into the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, then, who else
is in the house, and be careful what you say or we may be taking
you with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepster was very angry that Tulmin had slipped through his
fingers and apparently regarded the old man as an ally of the
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking me with you!&rdquo; the old fellow cried, in the
quavering accents of age.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taking me
where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prison, old chap,&rdquo; Pepster replied
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;People who won&rsquo;t answer questions
often find themselves in gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pure bluff and Pepster&rsquo;s superiors would probably
have had something rather drastic to say had they overheard
it.&nbsp; But the detective knew pretty well how far to go, and
with whom it was safe to go even that distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear sir, I have done nothing wrong,&rdquo; the
old man said, manifesting a sudden fluency which caused Pepster
to turn on him with a sharp glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a very old
man, gentlemen, seventy-seven, and I have never been in any
trouble of that sort, never, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making for it now,&rdquo; Pepster rejoined
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Pepster said, &ldquo;we asked you a
question&mdash;where&rsquo;s Thoyne?&nbsp; If you mean to <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>answer
that, get going, and quick.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t mean to
answer it, don&rsquo;t talk at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Thoyne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, if you would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Thoyne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who Mr. Thoyne is, I&mdash;I never
heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the other people&mdash;the servants&mdash;the
housekeeper&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nobody here but me, gentlemen, truly there is
nobody here.&nbsp; I am alone in the house, me, Silas Ballaker,
seventy-seven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long&mdash;I came to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came to-day&mdash;what do you mean, you came
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am Silas Ballaker and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you said that before, and you are seventy-seven
years of age.&nbsp; Neither statement interests us.&nbsp; We want
Mr. Thoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! hallo!&rdquo; cried suddenly a new voice.&nbsp;
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;Silas, who are these gentlemen?&nbsp; Ha! Mr.
Pepster, I did not recognise you.&nbsp; Have you come to take my
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Bannister,&rdquo; Pepster replied slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come to take any house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, a little irresolute, knowing that Mr. Bannister was
a different proposition from old Silas Ballaker and that he would
have to be a little more careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what you are doing here?&rdquo; Pepster went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is that a kindly personal inquiry from a friend or
is it asked in an official capacity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bannister was a little fat man, with two small, keen eyes
peering out of a sallow, bearded face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, purely personal,&rdquo; Pepster replied, a little
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;We came to see Mr. Thoyne.&nbsp; I was
merely surprised to see you where we expected&mdash;someone
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Thoyne, yes, he was my tenant.&nbsp; But he has
gone.&nbsp; Gave me notice some days ago, paid me up and cleared
out.&nbsp; A good tenant, very good.&nbsp; I was sorry to lose
him&mdash;yes.&nbsp; He said he was going back to America and he
left this morning.&nbsp; I sent old Silas here as
caretaker.&nbsp; Good old chap, Silas, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tapped his head significantly with the <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>forefinger
of his right hand.&nbsp; The old man did not see the movement but
he caught the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have come to take me to prison,&rdquo; he said
mournfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prison!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bannister.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; What for?&nbsp; What have you been doing,
old Silas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been doing nothing,&rdquo; Silas
quavered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this stout gentleman seemed mortally
offended and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Mr.
Bannister said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Mr. Pepster, what does all this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to see Mr. Thoyne and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we should like to look through the
house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, and no doubt you have a search
warrant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no search warrant,&rdquo; Pepster said
patiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am asking your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, let&rsquo;s do everything in order.&nbsp; No
warrant, no search.&nbsp; An Englishman&rsquo;s house, et cetera,
you know.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t be done, Mr. Pepster, can&rsquo;t be
done.&nbsp; Think what would happen if the papers got hold of
it.&nbsp; High-handed action by a Peakborough
detective&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers will not get hold of it if you don&rsquo;t
tell them,&rdquo; Pepster said quietly.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;Oh, one never knows.&nbsp; How do these fellows
get hold of things?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wonderful, but, you know,
it&rsquo;s their job.&nbsp; And your Chief is just a bit nervous,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could get a warrant in an hour,&rdquo; Pepster
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&nbsp; The house won&rsquo;t disappear in
an hour.&nbsp; It will still be here and so will old Silas.&nbsp;
But if it&rsquo;s Thoyne you want, a warrant&rsquo;ll not help
you.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His furniture is,&rdquo; I interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mr. Bannister replied, with an oily smile,
&ldquo;you are wrong there also.&nbsp; The furniture&rsquo;s
mine.&nbsp; I let it furnished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Thoyne go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was here.&nbsp; He handed me the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he a man named Tulmin with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a servant, a little man, but I don&rsquo;t know
what his name was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone away together,&rdquo; Pepster said,
turning to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along, there&rsquo;s nothing
more to do here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to go through the house&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
Bannister began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Pepster rejoined promptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take your refusal and if anything occurs
we&rsquo;ll call you as a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;Is Thoyne in the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good day to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned away and though Mr. Bannister did not quite seem to
like it, he made no effort to detain us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve gone away together,&rdquo; Pepster
repeated, as we strolled towards Stone Hollow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
has Thoyne taken Tulmin out of the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be only a coincidence,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a curious coincidence,&rdquo; Pepster
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that I rule coincidences out
myself.&nbsp; They happen.&nbsp; I have run up against some very
queer instances in my time.&nbsp; I once had a case in which a
man prepared a dose of poison for another man.&nbsp; The latter
died of poison and the other gave himself up to justice.&nbsp; A
clear case&mdash;but when the post-mortem took place it was found
that the victim had died of quite another sort of poison
altogether.&nbsp; He had, in fact, committed suicide and had
never taken the dose prepared for him by the would-be
murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if this isn&rsquo;t a coincidence, then there must
be an explanation,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How would this
do?&nbsp; Ronald Thoyne quarrels with Sir Philip Clevedon over
Miss&mdash;over a woman. <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>Then Thoyne pays Tulmin to
assassinate Sir Philip.&nbsp; That is why Thoyne took the man
into his service so promptly.&nbsp; But they find the chase
getting too hot for them and so they clear out.&nbsp;
What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the story?&rdquo; Pepster demanded, evidently
impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am quite sure it
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But it would fit the facts up to date,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go after Tulmin, anyway,&rdquo; Pepster
rejoined.</p>
<p>I nodded smilingly, but did not further discuss the matter
though I divined Thoyne&rsquo;s move.&nbsp; He had taken Tulmin
away in order to divert suspicion from young Clevedon.&nbsp; How
far Thoyne had taken Tulmin into his confidence I did not
know.&nbsp; Perhaps he had bluffed him as he had tried to bluff
me.&nbsp; And at all events he would have paid him well.&nbsp;
Whatever faults Thoyne may have possessed any form of parsimony
was certainly not one of them.</p>

154</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
THE VICAR&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was by means of the Vicar that
the story was carried a stage further.&nbsp; I had made the old
man&rsquo;s acquaintance soon after I first came to Cartordale
and had conceived a great liking for the gentle, kindly old
parson and his bustling, energetic, rather autocratic wife.</p>
<p>The Rev. Herbert Wickstead was an elderly man, with a thin,
colourless face, short-sighted eyes and a scholarly stoop.&nbsp;
As a preacher, he was not very much, for, though he did some hard
thinking and was now and again original, he possessed very little
gift for literary expression and none at all for oratory.&nbsp;
Nor was he very much more successful in parochial work, though
that did not greatly matter since his wife&mdash;Mrs. Vicar, as
she was generally labelled&mdash;possessor of the quickest of
tongues and the kindest of hearts, took the heaviest part of that
burden upon her own shoulders.</p>
<p>I met him by the vicarage on the afternoon <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>of the day
following our visit to Thoyne&rsquo;s house and when he asked me
to go in and have some tea I accepted chiefly because I thought
he, or at any rate Mrs. Vicar, might be able to tell me some of
the things I wanted to know.&nbsp; You see, I was still very much
of a stranger in Cartordale with only a vague and shadowy
knowledge of its people.&nbsp; In some ways that may have been a
gain though, generally speaking, it was a handicap.&nbsp; He
began on one of the subjects uppermost in my mind almost as soon
as we were seated at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry to learn to-day that we are losing Mr.
Thoyne,&rdquo; the Vicar said, in his halting drawl.</p>
<p>He took off his spectacles and polished them with the corner
of his handkerchief, peering mildly at the rest of us the while,
though his remark had evidently been addressed to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He very seldom came to church,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar
snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not frequently,&rdquo; the Vicar admitted,
&ldquo;not so frequently as I could have wished.&nbsp; But he was
very generous&mdash;very.&nbsp; Any story of distress or need was
very sure of a sympathetic hearing.&nbsp; I have dipped rather
deeply into his purse more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>&ldquo;Who told you he was leaving?&rdquo; his wife
asked.</p>
<p>The Vicar selected a slice of bread-and-butter with great
deliberation from the plate before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry I had no opportunity of bidding him
good-bye,&rdquo; he went on, apparently ignoring his wife&rsquo;s
question though most likely he had not heard it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;True I saw him yesterday but I had no chance then.&nbsp; I
was returning from a visit to Sarah Blooms&mdash;poor
woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died this morning,&rdquo; his wife chimed in, a
little snappily I thought, though that may have been because I
was not quite used to her conversational style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;dear me! dear me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vicar relapsed into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were telling us, sir&mdash;?&rdquo; I ventured,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course, I was returning from my visit to
Sarah Blooms and was passing the end of Pallitt&rsquo;s Lane when
Mr. Thoyne passed me in his motor-car.&nbsp; There was a lady
with him, Miss Clevedon, I think, though I could not be very sure
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they alone in the car?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, as far as I could see, quite alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Mr. Thoyne driving, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&ldquo;Oh, no, they were in the body of the car.&nbsp;
There was the chauffeur and another man on the front, a servant,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not recognise the second man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, to tell you the truth I did not take
particular notice of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at least level betting that the second man was
Tulmin.&nbsp; But what interested me most was the fact of Kitty
Clevedon&rsquo;s presence in the car.&nbsp; It seemed to suggest
that whatever was going on, she had a hand in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard their names coupled more than
once&mdash;Mr. Thoyne and Miss Clevedon,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; the Vicar queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had not heard it.&nbsp; But it would be a very suitable match
too.&nbsp; He has money and physical strength and she has youth
and beauty.&nbsp; That should make an ideal combination.&nbsp;
They seemed very happy and comfortable&mdash;I noticed
that.&nbsp; As they passed me he was talking to her, but they
both saw me.&nbsp; Thoyne nodded to me as they went
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know he&rsquo;s gone for good?&rdquo;
Mrs. Vicar demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it was Miss Kitty who told me that.&nbsp; I
met her again an hour or two later and I asked her if she thought
Mr. Thoyne would <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>take the chair next Wednesday.&nbsp; She said he
couldn&rsquo;t because he had left Cartordale and had given up
his house.&nbsp; She said, I think, that he was going
abroad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On his yacht, I expect,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar chimed
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky man!&rdquo; I interjected.&nbsp; &ldquo;So he
possesses a yacht, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lovely vessel,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar replied, with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen it, but he gave us
a lecture with limelight views, &lsquo;Round the World by
Steam&rsquo; he called it, and he showed us a lot of pictures of
his yacht.&nbsp; The <i>Sunrise</i> its name is, and he says he
gave it that name because he uses it to go where the sun
is&mdash;one of the privileges of wealth, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; she
added, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Mr. Thoyne been long in Cartordale?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it would be about two years, or, let me see,
perhaps a little longer,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He fought in the war, you know, and was wounded.&nbsp; He
stayed as a lodger for some months at Lepley&rsquo;s Farm and
then took Lennsdale which belongs to Mr. Bannister of
Peakborough, an auctioner and agent and all sorts of things
generally, who lets it furnished&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lepley,&rdquo; I murmured, &ldquo;that name seems
familiar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar went on, right in her
element now, &ldquo;you will be thinking of the girl who gave
evidence at the inquest, Nora Lepley, tall, good-looking, with
dark eyes.&nbsp; She lives at the farm though she sometimes stays
at White Towers with her aunt, the housekeeper there.&nbsp; I
remember there was some talk about Ronald Thoyne and Nora Lepley,
but there was nothing in it, or, anyway nothing came of it.&nbsp;
Talk&rsquo;s easy in a place like this, you know&mdash;there is
nothing else to do.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s always been plenty of
talk round Nora Lepley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good girl, my dear, a good girl,&rdquo; the Vicar
mildly interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, quite,&rdquo; Mrs. Vicar admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceptionally well able to take care of herself I
should imagine,&rdquo; was my own comment, whereat Mrs. Vicar
nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>It was two days after that conversation that I met Detective
Pepster in the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Holt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was coming to
see you.&nbsp; I have found out where Mr. Thoyne is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;there was no particular
mystery about that, was there?&nbsp; He&rsquo;d made none so far
as I know.&nbsp; What is the point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappeared?&nbsp; Do you call it that?&nbsp; He left
the furnished house he&rsquo;d been occupying and <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>went off to
his yacht, the <i>Sunrise</i>, but that isn&rsquo;t
disappearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;well, perhaps in a way it isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;m going to interview Mr. Ronald Thoyne for all that
and with a warrant in my pocket&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems likely that Thoyne&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t put my money on what is likely,&rdquo;
Pepster interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been had that
way.&nbsp; I once had a case of the theft of a diamond
ring.&nbsp; There were only three men possible&mdash;a bookmaker
who&rsquo;d once been in prison for horse-doping, a defaulting
bankrupt and a clergyman.&nbsp; I arrested the horse-doper and
kept an eye on the bankrupt, but it was the parson who had the
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to write your reminiscences,&rdquo; I
remarked dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking forward to doing so when my pension falls
due,&rdquo; Pepster returned, entirely unabashed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, now, let&rsquo;s talk business.&nbsp; The warrant
isn&rsquo;t for Thoyne himself, but for Tulmin.&nbsp; Thoyne will
come into it later&mdash;accessory after or before the fact, you
know.&nbsp; Tulmin will do to be going on with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Thoyne has taken Tulmin on board the yacht
with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps&mdash;perhaps
not.&nbsp; But Thoyne has spirited Tulmin away somehow, <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>somewhere.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that clear?&nbsp; And why
has he done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, you explained before that Thoyne had paid
Tulmin to murder Sir Philip&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Holt, that was your theory,&rdquo; Pepster
explained patiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you said you didn&rsquo;t
believe it.&nbsp; No, Thoyne may have done the murder himself, or
he may not, and Tulmin may have spotted him at it.&nbsp; But, to
tell the truth, I&rsquo;m not worrying about that just now.&nbsp;
It is Tulmin I want.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough against him to be
going on with, anyway, and I mean to get him and to learn why
Thoyne carried him off.&nbsp; Will you come down to Ilbay with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ilbay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the yacht&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go
to-morrow.&nbsp; I could go the next day, but not
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a breakdown in the machinery and he
can&rsquo;t shift for at least four days.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
that much anyhow.&nbsp; The day after to-morrow, then.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll send you a list of the trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour or so later I called at Hapforth <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>House and
was shown into the presence of Lady Clevedon and Miss Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old lady, a little tartly,
&ldquo;have you made any discoveries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned equably, &ldquo;several.&nbsp;
But I have run up against a brick wall and I&rsquo;ve come to you
to pull it down for me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get over it or under
it or round it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about!&rdquo;
the old lady cried irascibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The question
is&mdash;do you know who killed Philip Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it depends.&nbsp; Perhaps I
do, and possibly I am wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced casually at Miss Kitty Clevedon, over whose pretty
face some inward emotion had drawn a greyish pallor that extended
even to her lips.&nbsp; It was quite certain that the last thing
she wanted to hear was the name of the person who had killed Sir
Philip Clevedon.&nbsp; But she was seated a little behind the old
lady who noticed nothing.</p>
<h2><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
KITTY SENDS A TELEGRAM</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> when will you arrest
him?&rdquo; Lady Clevedon demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; I returned slowly, &ldquo;that is just
it.&nbsp; You see, the difference between knowing and proving is
several thousand miles and this brick wall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your brick walls!&rdquo; the old lady
cried, waving her hands with an impatient and fretful
gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see the murderer hanged and the
whole thing cleared away and forgotten.&nbsp; He was stabbed with
my hatpin and there are people silly enough to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Auntie, Mr. Holt must be able to prove his case
before he can arrest&mdash;anyone,&rdquo; Miss Kitty Clevedon
chimed in.</p>
<p>She spoke naturally and the colour had returned to her
cheeks.&nbsp; My graphic description of the difference between
knowledge and proof had apparently brought its consolation.</p>
<p>The old lady snorted disagreeably but seemed to have no
convincing retort ready.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;And what is the brick wall you chatter so much
about?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; I said slowly, examining the
back of my left hand with apparent solicitude, &ldquo;what hold
the late Sir Philip Clevedon had over Miss Clevedon that she
broke off her engagement with Mr. Ronald Thoyne and consented to
marry the late baronet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was for a moment or two a dead silence in the room, a
silence that could be felt and almost touched.&nbsp; It was the
old lady who finally exploded in a manifestation of wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece was never engaged to Ronald Thoyne,&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are impertinent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo; I queried, ignoring her concluding
sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she never promised to marry Sir Philip
Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned suddenly on the girl who, as I have said, was
seated a little behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that what they meant at the inquest?&rdquo; she
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;They said&mdash;that housekeeper,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;that Philip Clevedon and Ronald Thoyne
quarrelled over&mdash;over a&mdash;a woman.&nbsp; Was that
it?&nbsp; Tell me the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Mr. Holt is talking
about,&rdquo; the girl replied carelessly.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>She
had entirely recovered her equanimity and was completely mistress
of herself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not engaged to Mr. Thoyne?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sir Philip did not want to marry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon interposed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He proposed to you a year ago and you refused him.&nbsp;
Was it over you they quarrelled, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; Miss
Clevedon returned a little wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why they should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady rose from her seat and strode towards a little
bureau in one corner of the room from which she took a bundle of
newspaper cuttings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here is the report,&rdquo; she said, and she began
to read an extract from Mrs. Halfleet&rsquo;s evidence in a loud,
rather strident voice.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>I heard Sir Philip say</i>,
&lsquo;<i>You are talking nonsense</i>.&nbsp; <i>I cannot compel
her to marry me against her will</i>.&nbsp; <i>The decision rests
with her</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>He was not exactly shouting but was
speaking a little more loudly than usual</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mr. Thoyne
seemed angry</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>You must release her from her
promise</i>,&rsquo; <i>he said</i>.&nbsp; <i>His voice was hoarse
and he struck the table with his stick as he spoke</i>.&nbsp; <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span><i>I think
Sir Philip stood up from his seat then</i>.&nbsp; <i>I did not
see him</i>, <i>of course</i>, <i>but I seemed to hear him
walking up and down</i>.&nbsp; <i>And he spoke sharply</i>,
<i>almost angrily</i>.&nbsp; <i>The words appeared to come out
with a sort of snap</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>I have nothing to say in
this matter</i>,&rsquo; <i>Sir Philip declared</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>I neither hold her to her promise nor release her from
it</i>.&nbsp; <i>The decision rests solely with her</i>.&nbsp;
<i>If she notifies me that she cannot marry me</i>, <i>I have no
power to compel her</i>.&nbsp; <i>But I am not prepared to take
your word for it</i>.&nbsp; <i>The decision must come from
herself</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Mr. Thoyne said</i>, &lsquo;<i>That
is your last word</i>, <i>is it</i>?&rsquo; <i>to which Sir
Philip replied</i>, &lsquo;<i>My first word and my
last</i>.&nbsp; <i>As far as I am concerned I am engaged and
remain engaged until the young lady herself notifies me that the
engagement is at an end</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>Then Mr. Thoyne
said</i>, &lsquo;<i>If you don&rsquo;t release her I shall find a
way of making you</i>&mdash;<i>I shall find a
way</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old lady ceased reading and glanced at Kitty over the top
of her spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is behind it?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
me, what is behind it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Kitty said.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;was it&mdash;who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been&mdash;Nora Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>I
think she uttered the name quite on the spur of the moment and
with no previous intention of taking that way out.&nbsp; At all
events, for a moment or two the suggestion seemed rather to
impress the old lady, then she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that Nora Lepley&mdash;Philip
Clevedon was like all other men, I dare say, no better and no
worse.&nbsp; But he wouldn&rsquo;t want to <i>marry</i>
her.&nbsp; They might fight over Nora Lepley, yes, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t be because either of them wanted to marry
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they want to marry Nora&mdash;she
is very nice?&rdquo; Kitty said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, child,&rdquo; the old lady
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are democratic days&mdash;&rdquo; I was
beginning, but the old lady turned on me almost ferociously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t asking you for your views,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll leave it at that.&nbsp; These
two men quarrelled over Nora Lepley, or Jane Smith, or Martha
Tompkins, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose from my seat and stood regarding them with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so my question goes unanswered,&rdquo; I murmured,
&ldquo;and my brick wall remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady looked from me to Miss Kitty Clevedon and then
back again.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that ends the
case.&nbsp; You must drop it&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;drop
it.&nbsp; I am getting in deeper than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed quietly and then went towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seeing Mr. Thoyne at Ilbay to-morrow,&rdquo; I
said, pausing there to make quite sure Kitty heard me, &ldquo;and
I will ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left them, probably wondering what might be the precise
meaning of that last promise&mdash;or was it a threat?&mdash;and
finding my way out strolled slowly down to the big gates.</p>
<p>Once in the public road, however, I indulged in a course of
action that might possibly have seemed a little strange to an
uninitiated spectator.&nbsp; First of all I stood glancing here
and there around me as if looking for someone or something.&nbsp;
Then I made my way to the side of the road and clambered to the
top of a small pile of boulders on the summit of which I found a
seat on a flat stone, so placed that I was invisible to anyone
coming from Hapforth House or proceeding in either direction
along the road.&nbsp; Having made myself as comfortable as the
circumstances permitted, I took out my watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
for the test,&rdquo; I murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless I am out in
all my deductions Kitty Clevedon will emerge from Hapforth House
in something like half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>In
point of fact it was precisely twenty-three minutes, and
curiously enough she did exactly as I had done&mdash;stood
outside the big gates and looked carefully about her in all
directions.&nbsp; But there the resemblance ended.&nbsp; She did
not, like me, climb any of the neighbouring rocks, but set off at
a smart pace in the direction of Cartordale village, whither also
in a very few minutes I followed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mistake number
one, young lady,&rdquo; I murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should have
taken your car into Midlington.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t have
lost much time and you would have made it safe.&nbsp; Now, then,
for the post office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was right again.&nbsp; It was into the little village post
office that Kitty Clevedon turned.&nbsp; I did not follow her,
but instead stepped into the garden that ran alongside the house
and sat myself down on a rustic seat that stood just below a
small window, and was hidden from the roadway by a huge, black,
soft-water butt.&nbsp; It had been a discovery of my own, made
quite casually a few days previously, and merely noted as I noted
everything.&nbsp; From that seat it was possible to hear quite
plainly the tapping of the telegraph instrument within.&nbsp; Ah,
there it was now, tap-tap-tap-tap, H, TAP-tap-TAP, K, TAP-tap,
N&mdash;oh, yes, of course &ldquo;H. knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Kitty!&nbsp; She did not dream that the man <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>she dreaded
was seated under that little window reading her message as easily
as if she had shown him the form on which she had written
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;H. knows your address and is coming to-morrow to
see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I sped out of the garden and through the
village, and taking a short cut met Kitty on her way back to
Hapforth House.&nbsp; I was strolling along dragging my stick
behind me, and I stopped as I reached her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sent your telegram to Mr. Thoyne?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>She was trying to bluff me and I did not mean to spare
her.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; It was she who had declared
war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my&mdash;I do not understand you, Mr.
Holt,&rdquo; she stammered, for once taken off her guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a random shot of mine,&rdquo; I replied
smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I inadvertently let out that I was going
to Ilbay to see Mr. Thoyne, and it was natural you should want to
warn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have I to do with&mdash;with Mr. Thoyne, and
why should I want to warn him?&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you
visit him if you wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did send him a wire, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I
persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are impertinent, Mr. Holt!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I fear I am,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
often <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>has to be in such jobs as this.&nbsp; And it is your
own fault, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you challenge me by your whole attitude.&nbsp;
Your visit that night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already denied any visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You adhere to that&mdash;good.&nbsp; But, don&rsquo;t
you see that that is the challenge?&nbsp; And now we have this
quarrel between Thoyne and Sir Philip Clevedon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned on me swiftly with flaming cheeks and eyes that
sparkled angrily, but I interrupted the coming outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I have offended you,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;but I am afraid that was inevitable.&nbsp; You would have
done better to trust me.&nbsp; Anyway, I am in this case and I
intend to solve the problem it presents.&nbsp; If it is to be war
between us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, Mr. Holt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be war, then, and we&rsquo;ll fight it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I continued on my way, still dragging my stick behind
me.</p>
<h2><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
ON RONALD THOYNE&rsquo;S YACHT</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ilbay</span> we discovered to be a very
tiny village, hardly more than a cluster of cottages, a small inn
and a church.</p>
<p>There was a jetty, built of stone in a rough-and-tumble
fashion that clearly betokened amateur workmanship, and flanked
on either side by a semi-circular sweep of sandy beach that ended
in a jumble of rocks lying at the bases of tall cliffs.&nbsp; The
road came over the hills after threading its way through vast
moorlands and dipped steeply down to the village and the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yacht is still here,&rdquo; Pepster announced, on
his return from what he described as &ldquo;an early morning
prowl round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get a boat?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already annexed one,&rdquo; Pepster
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t waste time in this
case.&nbsp; The yacht may up-anchor and steam off at any
minute.&nbsp; The boat is ready and the men are
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is understood that you do all the talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t need much talking, but anyway
I&rsquo;ll start it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the sooner the better,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald Thoyne met us on the deck of the yacht and stood with
his hands clasped loosely behind him, surveying us with a queer,
twisted smile on his face.&nbsp; He waited for us to speak and
evidently had no intention of helping us out.&nbsp; If he
wondered how we had caught his trail he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come,&rdquo; Pepster began, &ldquo;for a word
or two with Tulmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tulmin!&rdquo; Thoyne exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
disappointment when I thought it was a friendly call on
myself.&nbsp; Though I can&rsquo;t say you look very friendly or
I might invite you to stay to lunch.&nbsp; I have quite a good
cook, a negro, certainly, but in his way a genius.&nbsp; Now
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Pepster said with a smile, &ldquo;you
are talking to gain time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; Thoyne replied calmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should I?&nbsp; Let us come down to bedrock
facts.&nbsp; Tulmin isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We traced him here,&rdquo; Pepster interposed in his
small, squeaky voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was here, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;Was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Pepster went on, &ldquo;I have a
warrant for his arrest, and if you continue to conceal him you
are interfering with the law, always a rather dangerous
proceeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little lecture is interesting,&rdquo; Thoyne
replied carelessly, &ldquo;but doesn&rsquo;t apply.&nbsp; You
see, I am an American citizen and your law doesn&rsquo;t interest
me.&nbsp; This ship sails under the Stars and Stripes, you know,
and you daren&rsquo;t forcibly seize anyone from under that
flag.&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t get angry&mdash;it won&rsquo;t pay
you.&nbsp; I have a dozen men on board who will obey my lifted
finger.&nbsp; If I told them to pitch you into the water, into
the water you would go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his back on us and leaning his elbows on the
brightly polished rail, gazed down into the cool, green depths of
the water that was lap-lapping idly against the sides of the
vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not angry,&rdquo; Pepster explained,
&ldquo;only interested.&nbsp; Is that your case&mdash;that Tulmin
is aboard the vessel, but that I dare not take him off an
American ship?&nbsp; If that is so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a damned fool!&rdquo; Thoyne retorted
roughly, facing us again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;more than I can help,&rdquo;
Pepster responded mildly.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;Well, anyway, you can search the yacht,&rdquo;
Thoyne went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tulmin isn&rsquo;t here&mdash;I know
nothing of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill note which
was answered almost simultaneously by a sprightly youth, who must
have been waiting near at hand, so rapid was his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bender, take this gentleman over the yacht and show him
everything&mdash;everything, damn you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepster glanced at me but I shook my head.&nbsp; I intended to
have a few words with Thoyne on my own account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good at a search,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is police work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time I had spoken since we had boarded the
yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Thoyne said, facing me with glaring
eyes, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what the hell sort of
game you think you are playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regarded him smilingly for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get Miss Clevedon&rsquo;s telegram?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;did she
tell&mdash;oh, <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&nbsp;
And I don&rsquo;t understand why you want to butt in on
this.&nbsp; What business of yours is it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought perhaps it was the telegram that caused
you to send Tulmin away so hurriedly yesterday,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>He stood glaring at me for a moment or two, then turned away
with a quick laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I let you go now you are here?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me that.&nbsp; You are in my power and I
could carry you and that fat fool who came with you to the ends
of the earth.&nbsp; What could you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it would be an enjoyable trip,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it would be all right.&nbsp; I would see to
that.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t ill-use you&mdash;only keep you
locked up until we were well away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;it sounds all
right.&nbsp; But in the first place, you can&rsquo;t move until
your missing machinery comes to hand and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you know about my missing
machinery?&rdquo; he roared.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, of course, I was
only talking off the top,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
doing nothing desperate.&nbsp; But, now, man to man, what is the
game?&nbsp; Put your cards on the table, face up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;And yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re not playing your own hand.&nbsp;
Well, it&rsquo;s a one-sided bargain, but I&rsquo;m
willing.&nbsp; Listen carefully and then do just as you like,
with this certainty in your mind that what you try to hide I
shall nevertheless discover.&nbsp; I need only remind you of what
I have already told you&mdash;Miss Clevedon&rsquo;s wire and
Tulmin&rsquo;s hurried departure, not to mention the missing
machinery.&nbsp; You may deny as much as you like but you know
full well it is all true.&nbsp; Now, then, for the story.&nbsp;
Pepster wants Tulmin in order that he may arrest him for the
murder of Sir Philip Clevedon.&nbsp; Not that he believes Tulmin
to be the principal or is quite sure that he actually did the
killing.&nbsp; But&mdash;why are you keeping Tulmin out of the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were,&rdquo; I agreed equably.</p>
<p>Thoyne glared at me speechlessly for a moment or two, then
threw back his head with a great, bellowing roar of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that your theory?&rdquo; he demanded, when he
had regained breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, still speaking with careful
deliberation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not very keenly interested in
Tulmin nor in yourself, except just in passing.&nbsp; <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>It is
someone&mdash;quite&mdash;different.&nbsp; Who stands to gain
most from Sir Philip Clevedon&rsquo;s death?&nbsp; Tell me
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face went as white as Kitty Clevedon&rsquo;s had done when
I made a similar suggestion in her presence at Hapforth
House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not clear on details,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;and what I want to know&mdash;the real reason, indeed, for
my being here&mdash;is why Miss Kitty Clevedon promised to marry
Sir Philip, though it is quite obvious that her affections
are&mdash;otherwise bestowed.&nbsp; Now let us take the course of
events.&nbsp; You quarrelled with Sir Philip Clevedon over a
woman&mdash;and that woman was Miss Kitty Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lie&mdash;a damned lie!&rdquo; he said thickly,
clenching his great fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was stated by Mrs. Halfleet at the
inquest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty&rsquo;s name&mdash;Miss Clevedon&rsquo;s name was
never&mdash;Mrs. Halfleet mentioned no name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Clevedon promised to marry Sir Philip and you
quarrelled with him in consequence.&nbsp; Why did she
promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&mdash;she never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you will tell me the name of the woman
over whom you quarrelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nobody you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;I have been told&mdash;it was
suggested&mdash;that it was Nora Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nora Lepley!&nbsp; What the devil has she to do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It is not my suggestion
because, you see, I know who the lady was.&nbsp; The one missing
link in my chain of evidence is not the lady&rsquo;s identity but
her reason for throwing you over and saying &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to
Sir Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&nbsp; What has it to do with
the&mdash;the murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you until I have all the
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not get the lady&rsquo;s name out of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want her name,&rdquo; I retorted
tranquilly, &ldquo;I know that already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not Miss Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor Nora Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am sure of that.&nbsp; But the name doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; Will you tell me why Miss Clevedon agreed to marry
Sir Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you nothing&mdash;nothing at all.&nbsp; You
are a damned Paul Pry.&nbsp; What business is it of
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then I&mdash;but here comes Mr. Pepster,
unsuccessful as I see and as I knew he would be.&nbsp; I will not
worry you any more just <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>now, Mr. Thoyne, but I will let you
know how I go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded cheerfully and made my way to the side where our boat
was moored, and, indeed, I think that if I had not moved out of
his way just then he would have hit me.</p>
<p>In tackling a case of this sort, any case, indeed, I like to
build up as I go along and leave no blank spaces.&nbsp; Very
often I have spent much time over some detail that had eluded me,
and occasionally I have found that time wasted.&nbsp; But far
more frequently it has happened that the fitting in of one
missing piece has straightened out much that followed.&nbsp; And
I like to observe my chronology.</p>
<p>This question of Kitty Clevedon and her engagement to the
baronet may seem trifling and I had no certainty myself of its
relative importance, but I was quite assured in my own mind that
I could make very little of what followed until I had
straightened that.&nbsp; There was no reasonable doubt that Kitty
Clevedon was the mysterious lady of the quarrel&mdash;she fitted
so completely into the picture.&nbsp; That both these men wanted
her was common gossip in the Dale and it seemed equally evident
that her preference was for Ronald Thoyne.&nbsp; Yet, apparently,
she had promised herself to the baronet.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>And why
should Thoyne quarrel with him over it?&nbsp; It was her right to
choose.&nbsp; The only possible explanation was that the promise
had been extracted from her by some means that had not left her a
free agent.&nbsp; And there was my missing piece.&nbsp; Why had
Kitty Clevedon promised to marry Sir Philip?</p>
<p>I received my first glimmer of light from Pepster, though it
was quite unconscious on his part.</p>
<p>The inn at Ilbay was a delightful old place, full of odd,
mysterious corners, quaint unexpected doorways and queerly shaped
rooms that were always a step or two below or a step or two above
the passage that led to them and thus constituted traps for the
unwary visitor.&nbsp; Pepster and I had a small parlour to
ourselves, a queer room with five walls and a couple of huge
beams crossed on the ceiling.&nbsp; It had a wide, open
fire-place but no grate, the pile of blazing logs resting on the
hearth, while the flames roared and spluttered into the darkness
of a capacious chimney.&nbsp; The room had only one small window
that looked out over the jetty and the bay, and was shrouded at
night by warm crimson curtains; and one had to climb three steps
in order to reach the door which opened into the bar.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Chief
among the furniture was a black oak dresser with an inscription
on the panel, reading, &ldquo;John and Annie Tumm, 1671,&rdquo;
but all the rest was new and neither good nor artistic.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;pictures&rdquo; consisted of the faded photographs of a
past generation, framed funeral cards and a Sunday School
certificate awarded to Elizabeth Tumm, 1874.&nbsp; The black oak
dresser and that document bridged 200 years of Tumms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfortable quarters,&rdquo; Mr. Pepster remarked, as
he sat in a big wicker chair toasting his toes at the fire and
sipping at a glass of hot whisky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I agreed, being similarly situated and
occupied at the other side of the hearthrug.&nbsp; There was
another long silence between us, which again Pepster broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a little
worried&mdash;no, that is hardly the word&mdash;a little
interested in Sir William Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not add that Sir William Clevedon was just then the
centre of all my own inquiries, but I was curious to hear what he
had to say about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Pepster went on, &ldquo;he has never
been to take up his title or the money.&nbsp; The title I could
understand.&nbsp; There are too many of them about in these days
to make any of <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>them really worth while.&nbsp; But he stands in also
for the cash&mdash;there was no will and Billy Clevedon takes the
lot.&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he has disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s rather a long word.&nbsp; But nobody
seems to know where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made inquiries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; He started a long leave on February
20th&mdash;his battalion is in Ireland, you know&mdash;and is
straightway lost.&nbsp; But as to where he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sister will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Clevedon tell you that herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not directly.&nbsp; It was old Parfitter, the
family lawyer, who dropped a hint, so to speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir
William Clevedon ought to be home looking after this business and
helping to clear up the mess,&rsquo; I said to him.&nbsp; The old
chap wagged his head mysteriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aye,&rsquo; he
replied, &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll be Sir William now, of
course&mdash;yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; I hazarded the opinion that his
long-delayed appearance was breeding rumours.&nbsp; &lsquo;For
his own sake he should come,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; The old fossil
took the alarm at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rumours? he asked
sharply.&nbsp; What rumours?&rsquo;&nbsp; He glared at me as if I
were in some way responsible.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, nothing
definite,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;just rumours, <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>mere
talk.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he opened out and let go, said he
would like to ask my advice and so on.&nbsp; In short, they
didn&rsquo;t know where Billy Clevedon was, none of them knew,
not even his sister.&nbsp; And there it is.&nbsp; He will turn up
in good time&mdash;if he hasn&rsquo;t some reason for stopping
away.&nbsp; The question is, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he what?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good reason for stopping away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was precisely the point at which I had arrived
myself.</p>

THE MYSTERY OF BILLY CLEVEDON</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tell</span> me,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;all you know about young Clevedon.&nbsp; His continued
absence is certainly interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I know very much about him,&rdquo;
Pepster said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, he never came under my survey
professionally, though according to accounts that was rather by
way of good luck than actual desert.&nbsp; When they were
children, brother and sister were inseparable and were always up
to mischief of some sort.&nbsp; Their parents died when they were
babies and they went to live at White Towers with old Lady
Clevedon.&nbsp; When she went back to Hapforth House on the death
of her husband, they went with her and in due time were packed
off to school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all that is common knowledge,&rdquo; I
interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what about Ireland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a captain in the 2nd Peakshires and they are
stationed in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;But apparently he isn&rsquo;t in Ireland
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He went
off on leave which began on February 20th and started for
Dublin.&nbsp; But whether he ever reached that city or what he
did next nobody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were very fond of each other, these two, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning the brother and sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were inseparable until their school-days
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay back in my basket chair and sent a long wraith of blue
smoke curling and winding towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be nothing in it,&rdquo; I murmured,
&ldquo;and yet why does he remain away?&nbsp; Suppose Thoyne and
Clevedon quarrelled over Kitty and young Billy
interfered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say it is impossible,&rdquo; Pepster
interposed, &ldquo;and if it had been a bullet or a blow from a
fist or a stick I might have looked at it seriously, but poison
is not Billy Clevedon&rsquo;s line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One never knows&mdash;there are no such things as
impossibilities.&nbsp; There is a story behind all
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepster sat for some minutes gazing meditatively into the
fire.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;There is a story behind it&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you really think young
Clevedon&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled at that and shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we have brought him to
Dublin and that is a long way from Cartordale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Pepster agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must bring him a bit nearer home.&nbsp; I wonder where
Tulmin is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You trot off to Dublin and look up young Billy,&rdquo;
I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will hang about here for a day or two
and see what I can pick up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilbay, as I think I have already said, consists only of a
score or so of tiny cottages clustered together at the foot of a
tall cliff to the left of the jetty, while to the right a rough
road goes upwards through what seems to be a narrow valley
running inland.&nbsp; I determined upon a walk, not that I
expected to discover anything thereabout, since the presence of
the <i>Sunrise</i> at Ilbay appeared to be due more to accident
than design.&nbsp; When I had been walking about half an hour I
met an old white-headed man, who had apparently emerged from a
jumble of hillocks and rocks by the roadside where perhaps he had
been resting.&nbsp; He stood leaning heavily on his stick and
surveying me with bleared, age-dimmed eyes which, however, showed
no surprise nor any other interpretable sentiment.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;Where does this road go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road&mdash;where does it go?&rdquo; he repeated,
mumbling his words from a mouth that was evidently all but
toothless, &ldquo;wey, it goes over yonder&rdquo;&mdash;and he
pointed vaguely into the grey distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the next village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh aye, that&rsquo;ll be Little Upton, a matter of
seven mile maybe and maybe twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned abruptly away and continued his walk towards the
coast.</p>
<p>The road ran desolate and unfrequented, with open moorland on
either side, as grim and forbidding as open moorland can be in
early spring before winter has taken its final departure.&nbsp;
The little fishing hamlet lay behind me hidden by the rising
ground, while before and around me were only illimitable open
spaces within an unbroken pall of grey sky overhead&mdash;no sign
of human habitation anywhere visible.&nbsp; I decided that Ilbay
was the more attractive and that I had nothing to gain by going
on.</p>
<p>And it was just here at the loneliest and dreariest turn of
the road that I met Ronald Thoyne again coming towards me with
long, swinging strides.&nbsp; He stopped and faced me with a
rather twisted grin.</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Still on the trail, Mr. Holt?&rdquo; he said,
with half a sneer: &ldquo;Any discoveries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several,&rdquo; I returned cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am, in short, getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must possess a really attractive collection of
mare&rsquo;s-nests,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few&mdash;yes.&nbsp; But this isn&rsquo;t one.&nbsp;
Not but what there are still puzzles in it.&nbsp; I can well
understand that when Miss Kitty Clevedon told her brother that
she had been compelled to promise to marry Sir Philip, he should
offer to set her free by threatening to mur&mdash;no, keep your
hands off me, Thoyne.&nbsp; But what I haven&rsquo;t yet settled
is why she promised to marry Sir Philip or what hold he had over
her.&nbsp; There is a story behind it that would solve the
puzzle, but I haven&rsquo;t got it yet.&nbsp; I shall get it
though, and if it involves young Clevedon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I broke off there with a short laugh, stepping back just in
time to avoid the quick, nervous blow Thoyne aimed at me with his
stick.&nbsp; He recovered himself on the instant and grinned a
little ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think Billy Clevedon murdered Sir Philip,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you are hopelessly out of your reckoning.&nbsp; A
bullet or a blow, perhaps, but not poison.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t
Billy&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Pepster, I remembered, had said the same thing and I
merely duplicated my reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;one never
knows.&nbsp; Where is he, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never pretend a
knowledge I do not possess.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where he
is&mdash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I would give &pound;5,000 at this moment if I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is innocent,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he is a fool
for stopping away, and no less, perhaps, if he is guilty because,
at least, his guilt has to be proved.&nbsp; If you are hiding him
you are doing him no service.&nbsp; I am not looking for him but
the police are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you expect otherwise?&nbsp; Here you have a title
and a fortune and the owner refuses to come and take them.&nbsp;
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said a little wistfully, &ldquo;that
you and I were on the same side of the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning by that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you were with us instead of against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I paused long and my reply to that was very carefully
considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thoyne,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not on any
side&mdash;I am not for or against anyone.&nbsp; I deal <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>only in
facts.&nbsp; If I convinced myself that young Clevedon murdered
Sir Philip, I should say so.&nbsp; I have no reason for thinking
that he did and certainly no desire to drag him into it.&nbsp; I
am not fighting you nor anybody.&nbsp; You do not think young
Clevedon murdered Sir Philip, or you try not to think so, but at
the back of your mind is the fear that he did.&nbsp; You are
therefore prejudiced but not, as you may think, in his
favour.&nbsp; Your very horror of the possibility persuades you
to treat it almost as a probability.&nbsp; But I, on the other
hand, consider only evidence.&nbsp; I have no personal views in
favour and certainly no prejudices against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what evidence have you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;except what you and Miss
Clevedon have provided and what his absence emphasises.&nbsp; If
you and she had kept out of it and he had been at Cartordale, as
he should have been, no suspicion ever would have attached to
him.&nbsp; At this moment the only evidence against him is the
belief you and Miss Clevedon harbour, that he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paced from one side of the road to the other and then back
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I dared tell you the whole story,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you could help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>Without another word he resumed his walk and plodded
steadily on without so much as a backward glance.</p>
<p>But I knew now that my surmises were accurate&mdash;that Sir
William Clevedon&rsquo;s continued and unexplained absence was
breeding deadly and sinister fears in the bosoms of his friends,
of his sister especially.&nbsp; That she was at the bottom of
Thoyne&rsquo;s mysterious activities seemed clear enough.&nbsp;
It was for her sake, probably at her instigation, that he had
tried so hard to envelop me in fog.&nbsp; And it seemed evident
that she was in possession of knowledge which, so far, neither
Pepster nor myself had penetrated.&nbsp; It would be my business
to discover what that was.&nbsp; I had not, however, very long to
wait.</p>
<h2><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
MORE ABOUT BILLY CLEVEDON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thoyne</span> must have started off
immediately for Cartordale because it was no later than the next
morning, while I was seriously considering whether I should
return home or follow Pepster to Dublin that I received a wire
from Thoyne reading: &ldquo;Can you see K.C. and self at C.
to-morrow?&rdquo;&nbsp; K.C. was Kitty and C. was Cartordale and
I was not long in making up my mind.&nbsp; I wired off a prompt
reply suggesting Stone Hollow as the place of meeting.&nbsp; They
were awaiting me when I arrived and they had evidently agreed
that Thoyne should start the talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know,&rdquo; he began slowly, &ldquo;which
side you would take if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped there, perhaps expecting me to help him out.&nbsp;
But I remained stubbornly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he went on, taking a sudden plunge,
&ldquo;you proved that&mdash;that Clevedon did&mdash;was involved
in&mdash;in the death of Sir <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Philip&mdash;would you take your
proof to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make no promises either way,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You sent for me and I am here.&nbsp; Why
did you invite me to come and what have I to do with it,
anyway?&nbsp; You need say nothing unless you wish.&nbsp; And in
any case, I am not a detective but a writer of
books&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why need you tell the police?&rdquo; Kitty
interposed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them what?&rdquo; I demanded, turning suddenly
upon her.</p>
<p>She paled a little and shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say I should tell the police,&rdquo; I went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, I decline to discuss the point.&nbsp; I
retain absolute freedom and if you prefer to say good-bye, well,
the decision rests with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; Thoyne blurted out, &ldquo;the
thing is so much a nightmare to us, that we must settle it one
way or the other.&nbsp; It would be better almost to know the
worst than to rest in continual doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we think you can help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a detective: I take no fees: I go my own way:
I make no promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We accept your conditions,&rdquo; Thoyne said, <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>with a
glance at Kitty who nodded an affirmative.</p>
<p>The story they told me was certainly interesting and what they
omitted at the first telling, I managed to elicit by subsequent
questioning.</p>
<p>Sir Philip Clevedon, it seemed, had given Kitty to understand
that her brother was in some danger, though he had been
judiciously vague, depending more upon hints, suggestions and
innuendo than on definite statements.&nbsp; He was easily able to
startle an impressionable girl where a man or an older woman
might have been able to extract the truth from him by a process
of cross-examination.</p>
<p>Only one thing stood out clear, that Billy was in some kind of
a mess from which it would cost far more money than she possessed
to extricate him, and that Sir Philip would find the cash if she
consented to marry him, which she did.&nbsp; Sir Philip&rsquo;s
action could only be justified by the old adage that
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair in love and war.&rdquo;&nbsp; Undoubtedly
he was very much in love with her which may be urged as his
justification.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have wealth and a title and I am
not an old man,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;and you have youth
and beauty; it is not an unequal bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
true enough.&nbsp; Marriages <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>far less appropriate occur every
day.&nbsp; But nothing would have induced Miss Kitty Clevedon to
consent except the thought that by her sacrifice she was saving
her brother from some disaster, the details of which she did not
understand.</p>
<p>Then came a very difficult task, to tell Ronald Thoyne that
their little romance was ended and that she was going to marry
Sir Philip Clevedon.&nbsp; Thoyne seems to have written straight
off to Billy Clevedon, in which he was wise, and then went and
had a row with Sir Philip, which was foolish.</p>
<p>Billy Clevedon as soon as he received Thoyne&rsquo;s letter
seems to have rushed off to Midlington where he summoned both
Thoyne and Kitty to meet him.&nbsp; There under pressure from
him, not unassisted perhaps by Thoyne, she told the story of her
interview with Sir Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The swine!&rdquo; Billy cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
unbuttered swine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wring his filthy neck for
him.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not marry him, Kitty, I&rsquo;ll do for
him first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very angry and swore mightily, but they paid little
heed to his wrath.&nbsp; It was characteristic of him to be a
trifle over-emphatic in his expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him to lend me some money, it is <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it wasn&rsquo;t as
much as he told you and it didn&rsquo;t matter in that way.&nbsp;
I was in a hole but that was nothing new and there was no
disgrace attached to it.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll settle it&mdash;you
leave to me.&nbsp; Kiss Ronny Thoyne and make it up with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy took two or three turns up and down the room, spitting
out the words as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blackmail,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But of course it&rsquo;s nonsense.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t
make her if&mdash;does she <i>want</i> to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not,&rdquo; Thoyne told him promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I should think not.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s twice her age
and more.&nbsp; But I see his game&mdash;he must be an infernal
cad.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t suspect that of him.&nbsp; He is cold
and selfish but I did not think he was that sort of
reptile.&nbsp; I knew nothing of this, Thoyne&mdash;you believe
that, don&rsquo;t you.&nbsp; I am a mixture like most men but I
am not that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his restless pacing to and fro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea of it, none at all,&rdquo; he
repeated.&nbsp; He did not tell them what the trouble was nor why
he had wanted the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have lent&mdash;&rdquo; Thoyne was beginning,
but Billy airily dismissed the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right for a bit and I&rsquo;ll make the
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>blasted
baronet shell out somehow,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m busy
now&mdash;an engagement I must meet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you
later on.&nbsp; Meanwhile you cut clear of the swine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming to Cartordale?&rdquo; Kitty
asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;but not
to-night.&nbsp; Thoyne, you take her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne did and left her at Hapforth House early in the
evening.</p>
<p>The next day&mdash;the fatal 23rd&mdash;passed without any
word from Billy.&nbsp; We know what happened on that
day&mdash;Thoyne&rsquo;s quarrel with the baronet and
Kitty&rsquo;s visit to White Towers in the evening.&nbsp; But the
latter did not return directly to Hapforth House.&nbsp; She ran
her little two-seater into Midlington only some twelve miles
distant and called at the hotel at which she had met her brother
on the previous day.&nbsp; But he was not there.&nbsp; He had
paid his bill, packed his bag and departed.</p>
<p>She returned to Cartordale but her car broke down on the way
and she pushed it to the side of the road and tried a short cut
to Hapforth House, missing her way in the fog and landing in my
study.&nbsp; The next day came the tragic story of Sir
Philip&rsquo;s death and though both she and Thoyne affected to
believe that Billy could have <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>had nothing to do with it, they were
nevertheless terribly anxious and alarmed, the more as the days
went on and nothing was heard of or from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let me reduce it to definite dates,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will check me if I am wrong.&nbsp; You
left your brother at the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; in
Midlington on the afternoon of February 22nd.&nbsp; He left the
hotel on the morning of February 23rd.&nbsp; Sir Philip Clevedon
died on the night of the 23rd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded a joint affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, and to put it in its most brutal form,
he left Midlington and came secretly to Cartordale, having first
obtained some poison, secured an entrance to White Towers,
poisoned Sir Philip&rsquo;s whisky, disappeared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rdquo; Kitty
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of course you don&rsquo;t,
but that summary of possibilities represents your
fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he show up?&rdquo; Thoyne
interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;that is precisely the
question we have to answer.&nbsp; Could he have got into White
Towers without being seen? You and he lived there as children and
I have <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>been told that you were veritable little imps of
mischief.&nbsp; All sorts of things would be possible in
connection with a big and ancient mansion like White
Towers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty looked woefully distressed and turned with white-faced,
pathetic pleading to Thoyne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should tell everything, Kitty, dear,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a secret way into White Towers which we
discovered years ago,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;We agreed
to keep it to ourselves and I have never told anyone.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think anyone knows of it except my brother and
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I regarded her thoughtfully for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know of that
secret way&mdash;could you have entered White Towers and placed
the poison in that bottle without being seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you don&rsquo;t think I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, look,&rdquo; I said, importing a sudden
harshness into my tones, &ldquo;you hated the thought of marrying
Sir Philip and his death would mean your release, besides which
it would mean wealth to your brother and a happy issue from his
financial&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;But the suggestion is infamous,
intolerable!&rdquo; Thoyne cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; I advised him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not accusing Miss Clevedon; I am summarising the case
against her brother.&nbsp; The first essential is to establish a
motive and there you have one twice over&mdash;Sir Philip&rsquo;s
death would release his sister from a hateful marriage and it
would&mdash;he would succeed to the dead man&rsquo;s title and
money.&nbsp; I am being purposely brutal because I want to put it
at its worst.&nbsp; He comes to Midlington, a few miles from
Cartordale on the day before the tragedy, he leaves Midlington
for some unknown destination, which may, however, have been
Cartordale, a few hours before the murder, he knows a secret way
into White Towers, and he has a dual motive for assassinating Sir
Philip.&nbsp; You have summed all this up in your own minds,
haven&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; It has been a dark shadow in your
thoughts ever since that tragic day.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thoyne said at length, &ldquo;you are
perfectly right.&nbsp; You have described exactly what, as I said
before, has been a ceaseless nightmare to us.&nbsp; And you have
omitted the main difficulty.&nbsp; Why doesn&rsquo;t he come to
Cartordale?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;But, now,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;let us take
the other side.&nbsp; There is no evidence of any sort that
Clevedon ever had any prussic acid in his possession.&nbsp; Or is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know of none,&rdquo; Thoyne assented eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I asked, turning to Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head, &ldquo;I never
heard of any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there is the possibility that when he left
Midlington he never came to Cartordale at all.&nbsp; That is
where our investigation begins.&nbsp; Where did he go when he
left Midlington?&nbsp; Let us return to your interview in the
&lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;&nbsp; At what time did it take
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the afternoon,&rdquo; Thoyne responded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be three o&rsquo;clock when we left the
&lsquo;King&rsquo;s Head.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he give you no indication of the nature of his
engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say when he was coming to Cartordale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he mentioned it&mdash;at all
events, nothing definite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, let me put it like this.&nbsp; Suppose that
after the meeting at Midlington there had <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>been no
tragedy, would your brother&rsquo;s prolonged absence have
worried you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Kitty replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;One never
knew what Billy was going to do and frequently he wasn&rsquo;t
sure himself.&nbsp; He would just do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that your brother
was going on a long leave.&nbsp; It is rather a wonder that
Thoyne&rsquo;s letter ever reached him, but evidently it
did.&nbsp; The fact that he had obtained leave before the receipt
of that letter suggests some contemplated purpose&mdash;the visit
to Midlington was only a break in the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Thoyne said, &ldquo;we have thought all
that out.&nbsp; But why hasn&rsquo;t he come back when&mdash;it
is unbelievable that he should have seen nothing&mdash;no account
of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlikely, but not impossible,&rdquo; I observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He may have met with an accident, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have heard of it,&rdquo; Thoyne said, shaking
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; I returned, as cheerfully as I
could, &ldquo;suppose we accord him the right every Briton has
under the law, of being regarded as innocent until he is proved
guilty.&nbsp; Is he, by the way, interested, do you know, in
any&mdash;lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>&ldquo;In about a hundred, I should think,&rdquo;
Thoyne returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say he would be.&nbsp; At his age one
is.&nbsp; But I mean any special lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they could give me no help in that.</p>

205</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
THE ANONYMOUS LETTERS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing I had to settle was
as regards the entrance to White Towers of which Kitty Clevedon
had spoken.&nbsp; We had to pick up Billy Clevedon&rsquo;s tracks
after he left Midlington, and if he really had gone to White
Towers, it would probably be by that route.&nbsp; At all events
there was absolutely no evidence he had been seen at any of the
usual entrances.&nbsp; Kitty agreed to guide us, and told us to
meet her the following morning at the main gates to White Towers;
and she advised us also to put on some old clothes as we should
have to creep part of the way on hands and knees.</p>
<p>We were prompt to time and Kitty took us through the park to
some very rough ground at the rear of the house, though not far
away from it, and there she showed us a narrow cleft in a mass of
rock and told us that was the entrance.&nbsp; It was partly
choked by a jumble of fallen boulders overgrown with the rough <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>vegetation
of the moor, probably rank enough at some periods of the year,
but lying now for the most part dry and dead.&nbsp; I looked for
any sign of recent entrance, especially for footmarks; but the
ground was too hard and revealed nothing, though the rubbish at
the entrance seemed to have some appearance of being
trampled.&nbsp; I took out my flash lamp and pushed my way into
the opening, followed by the others, though it was a very tight
fit for Thoyne.</p>
<p>A wall of rock confronted us at about four feet, but Kitty
bade us turn to the left and there I saw an opening low down
which seemed to lead to a passage that descended somewhere into a
mass of pitch darkness.&nbsp; We had to get on hands and knees
and crawl along so for quite a long distance through a low,
narrow tunnel that appeared to be for the most part natural,
though here and there, it had evidently been widened at least, if
not entirely pierced by human agency.</p>
<p>Presently, after going steadily downwards for many yards, it
went forward on the level, and was there a little higher and
wider; but at no point did it enable us to stand erect.&nbsp; It
was a case of creeping all the way.&nbsp; I understood now why
Kitty had advised the oldest possible <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>clothing.&nbsp; It meant ruin to the
knees of one&rsquo;s trousers.&nbsp; And then the tunnel ended
abruptly against a wall of solid rock; but Kitty cried out that
there was an iron ring close to my right hand, and that I must
take hold of it and pull hard.</p>
<p>I obeyed; there was a grinding and groaning as of rusty
machinery and then the rock in front swung back and we found
ourselves in an open chamber with walls and floor of natural
rock, but a roof of worked stone formed of square flags, all save
one supported by pillars of rusty iron.&nbsp; There were nine
stone flags, each six feet by four, and eight pillars, and the
dimensions of the cellar or cave were thus eighteen feet by
twelve.&nbsp; The height would probably be about eight
feet.&nbsp; We could at least stand upright.&nbsp; I took my
flash lamp and carefully examined every corner, not, as it turned
out, quite unremuneratively.&nbsp; I dropped my hat and then
stooped to pick it up again&mdash;and with it something I had
noticed lying there.</p>
<p>My find was a hairpin still fresh and bright and with no sign
of rust about it.</p>
<p>If Kitty Clevedon had passed that way I should have supposed
that she had dropped it.&nbsp; Ladies shed things of that sort as
they go.&nbsp; But she had assured us that she had not been near
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>the
spot; in which case a knowledge of the existence of the passage,
supposed to be confined to Kitty and her brother, was shared by
someone else, and that a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the way out?&rdquo; I asked, saying nothing of
the hairpin which, at a favourable opportunity, I thrust into my
waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>Kitty pointed to the one unsupported flagstone and told us
that it worked on a swivel and could be pushed up if one could
reach it, whereupon Thoyne swarmed up the nearest pillar and
tried to move the stone but failed, though whether because the
axle was rusty or because there was some fastening on the other
side we could not say.&nbsp; Thoyne selected another pillar and
once more gave the stone a push, but with no more success than
before.&nbsp; From his position, clinging monkey-like to the
pillar, he could exert very little leverage.&nbsp; He slid down
again and suggested that I should mount his shoulders so as to be
right under the stone, a man&oelig;uvre which was promptly
attempted with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The stone moved, though slowly and stubbornly and with much
creaking and, swinging myself up through the opening thus
disclosed, I found myself in a cellar full of a miscellaneous
collection of rubbish, baskets, boxes, barrels, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>chairs,
broken furniture of all sorts, books and papers and so on.&nbsp;
I fixed the stone in position, because left to itself it would
simply have swung back again into its place, and then I passed
down to the others a short ladder which I found lying against one
of the walls of the cellar.</p>
<p>When the others had joined me, Kitty explained that we were
under the older portion of White Towers, the East Wing, which was
partly in ruins and uninhabited.</p>
<p>I was easily able to explain the tunnel&mdash;I had seen
something of the sort in other old houses.&nbsp; It was simply a
way of escape for those inside if enemies became too
pressing.&nbsp; Peakshire had played a strenuous part in the
Civil War, most of the big men being on the side of the King and
White Towers, the older part of which dated back beyond
Elizabeth, had probably been a Royalist stronghold and meeting
place.&nbsp; If enemies, in the shape of Cromwell&rsquo;s men,
came along, the Cavaliers would only have to creep through the
tunnel in order to escape the Roundheads.&nbsp; Or it may have
been constructed in even earlier days for the benefit of Roman
Catholic refugees.</p>
<p>That, however, was mere speculation, though not without
interest.&nbsp; For many years evidently it had been unused and
forgotten until it was <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>rediscovered by the two children who
had kept it a delightful secret to themselves and had, no doubt,
brought it into many exciting games.&nbsp; The question for us,
however, was&mdash;had Clevedon used it recently, and if so, for
what purpose? It was certainly interesting and possibly
significant that somebody evidently had been that way not so very
long before.&nbsp; But Clevedon at all events did not use
hairpins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be no evidence that your brother ever
came this way,&rdquo; I said, as we stood looking round us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;True, the vegetation at the entrance to that passage bore
some appearance of having been trampled down, though that may
have been the weather or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; Thoyne broke in quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kitty told me about this before I saw you and I went to
look for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at him casually.&nbsp; It was quite likely he spoke
the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get as far as this?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t get beyond the
entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think you trampled that brushwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;it is possible I may have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not notice its condition
before&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, I wasn&rsquo;t looking for
that.&nbsp; I see you still distrust me,&rdquo; he added quickly,
<a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&ldquo;but I am perfectly honest about it.&nbsp; I am
sorry I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; I returned
carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been there, the
signs might have proved that Clevedon hadn&rsquo;t either,
whereas now it is an open question.&nbsp; But the fact that
somebody may have been there is of minor importance unless there
is accompanying evidence that the somebody was Clevedon
himself.&nbsp; Of course, there is the fact that he alone knew of
the entrance&mdash;he and one other.&nbsp; I suppose you
haven&rsquo;t been here lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned suddenly on Kitty Clevedon and rapped out the
question with the abruptness of a pistol shot.&nbsp; She started
a little, then shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I was a child,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we get out of this without returning by that
passage?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, through that door is a flight of stone steps
leading to what used to be the kitchen of the old White
Abbey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go that way,&rdquo; I decided.</p>
<p>When I had parted from my two companions, with a promise to
see them again later in the day, or, possibly on the following
morning, I went into the post office and from my waistcoat pocket
produced a hairpin.</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Have you any of that sort in stock?&rdquo; I
asked, then, noting her look of surprise, I added, &ldquo;I hope
you won&rsquo;t give me away if I tell you that I use them to
clean my pipe.&nbsp; They are the best things I know for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t suppose you wanted them for your
hair,&rdquo; she said pertly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we have plenty of
that sort in stock.&nbsp; Indeed, I don&rsquo;t think we have any
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose every lady in the Dale uses them,&rdquo;
I remarked jestingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them,&rdquo; she agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do&mdash;see, here is one&rdquo;&mdash;and she extracted a
specimen from her own abundant head-covering.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few
may get some others when they go into Midlington, but most come
here for them.&nbsp; Lady Clevedon had three boxes only a week
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clevedon,&rdquo; I echoed, &ldquo;then they must
be an aristocratic brand.&nbsp; Does her ladyship do her own
shopping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are good enough.&nbsp; No, Lady Clevedon
didn&rsquo;t come for them&mdash;Miss Kitty fetched them.&nbsp;
She said they were for Lady Clevedon, but she took some for
herself too, so I suppose she wears them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the hairpin was not going to be of much use to me,
at all events as a means of <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>identification.&nbsp; There would be
too many of them about the Dale for that.</p>
<p>When I reached Stone Hollow again I found Detective Pepster
awaiting me, looking, for him, a little disconsolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; was my greeting, &ldquo;how has Fate
treated you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck, none at all,&rdquo; Pepster said
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am just back from Dublin with no
news.&nbsp; Clevedon went to Dublin on February 20th, but there
all trace of him ended.&nbsp; I could learn nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been more fortunate than you,&rdquo; I returned
smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can carry him a bit farther than
that.&nbsp; He was in Midlington on February 22nd and left there
on the morning of the 23rd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you <i>know</i> that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go to Cartordale&mdash;to White
Towers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his sister&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is as ignorant as you or I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is bluffing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really doesn&rsquo;t know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;But&mdash;anyway we must find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am busy at it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any traces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a weird development.&nbsp; Did he do it?&nbsp; Is
he keeping out of the way because&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to say.&nbsp; We know that he came to
Midlington, but that he came to Cartordale or ever had any
prussic acid in his possession&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; We must bring him a
little nearer than Midlington.&nbsp; But if he didn&rsquo;t do
it, or, for the matter of that, if he did, he is a fool for
keeping out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which at least was a self-evident proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that we have disposed of Billy Clevedon for the
time being,&rdquo; Pepster went on, &ldquo;tell me what you think
of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great deliberation he took a letter-case from his pocket
and from it extracted a sheet of paper which he handed over to
me.&nbsp; It was lined paper, torn evidently from a notebook, and
on it was printed in capitals:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">YOU ARE ON THE WRONG<br
/>
TRAIL ALTOGETHER.&nbsp; IF<br />
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO<br />
KILLED CLEVEDON KEEP<br />
YOUR EYE ON THOYNE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;That is No. 1,&rdquo; Pepster said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is No. 2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed me a second document, but this time it was a plain
white paper on which the ink had run rather badly, though the
letters were quite legible.&nbsp; It was, too, much shorter,
simply reading:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THOYNE MURDERED
CLEVEDON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Anonymous letters by some crank, who thinks he has made
a discovery,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pepster agreed, &ldquo;but here is No.
3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third communication was written in red ink on a
buff-coloured slip of paper, such as Government offices use, and
read:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">YOU ARE MISSING YOUR<br
/>
LIFE&rsquo;S CHANCE.&nbsp; ARREST<br />
THOYNE AND I WILL PRODUCE<br />
THE EVIDENCE.<br />
TRUST ME.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Were they addressed to you personally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to my private address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently somebody who knows you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come by post?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Postmark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two Cartordale, the third Midlington.&nbsp; Now, is the
writer merely a crank, or has he something up his
sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do nothing he&rsquo;ll probably write again and
may be more explicit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, Thoyne is very deep in this thing, but
there is nothing definite connecting him with the murder&mdash;is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I merely shook my head vaguely at that.&nbsp; In this
curious case one never knew what a day might bring forth.&nbsp;
The changes and developments were as rapid as a cinema show.</p>

217</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
THE HAIRPIN CLUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> point of fact the first real
clue I secured in this case consisted of that hairpin I found on
the floor of the lower cellar, though its bearing on the mystery
was not at first apparent.&nbsp; But it introduced me to a new
set of circumstances and took me a step or two on the road I
wished to travel.&nbsp; Until then I had been wandering round and
round in a circle.&nbsp; My first thought was that the hairpin
belonged to Kitty Clevedon and that she had deliberately deceived
me when she declared that she had not visited the cellar prior to
conducting Thoyne and myself thither.&nbsp; My suspicion was that
she had been there and that she had found and removed some traces
of her brother&mdash;that she was, in fact, still playing a game
of bluff; though I did not believe that this time Thoyne was in
it.&nbsp; She was hoodwinking him as well as myself.</p>
<p>I set a watch on the cellar beneath the ruined wing, making
myself a hiding-place by clearing out some of the furniture in
one corner and <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>restacking it so as to leave a narrow passage in which
I could conceal myself if I wished.&nbsp; And I set little traps
of a very simple description, but sufficient to show me on my
next visit that somebody had been there in my absence and had
penetrated to the lower chamber by way of the swinging flagstone;
but I was more than astonished when during one of my periods,
behind my little rampart, I discovered that the visitor was not
Kitty Clevedon at all, but&mdash;Nora Lepley.</p>
<p>In all my imaginings my thoughts had never once turned to
her.&nbsp; She came in without faltering or hesitation, as one
who knew her way intimately, and swung open the trap-door, which
she propped up by means of a board.&nbsp; Then, taking the short
ladder which I have already mentioned, and which I knew by means
of my little arrangements had been used during my absence, she
let it down, and by it descended to the lower cellar.</p>
<p>As soon as her head had disappeared I crept to the opening on
hands and knees and saw her lift out a rough block of stone which
concealed a small opening not unlike a natural cupboard.&nbsp;
Then she took a small flash-lamp from the pocket of her big apron
and sent a beam of light into the hollow place, but situated as I
was I <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>could not see whether she put anything in or took
something out.&nbsp; For a minute or two she stood pondering
almost as if she were trying to make up her mind on some doubtful
point, then with a quick sigh she replaced the lamp in her pocket
and restored the stone.</p>
<p>I flitted back swiftly and noiselessly to my own corner whence
I watched her return from the lower depths, close down the stone
and lay the ladder along the wall, all with sedate, unhurried
movements, as one who had no reason to fear interruption.&nbsp;
When she was quite safely away, and I followed her to make sure,
I went in my turn into the lower cellar to investigate that
little cupboard.&nbsp; It was evidently her own private safe,
containing all sorts of oddments a young girl might hide away
when she found too many prying eyes at home&mdash;a bundle of
letters, an envelope containing &pound;20 in Treasury notes, some
oddments of jewellery and so on.</p>
<p>But what most attracted my attention, because they were in
such curious contrast with the rest of the collection, were a
drinking-glass and a small phial wrapped in white paper.&nbsp; I
picked the latter up and noticed a number of figures lightly
pencilled on the wrapper arranged in double column thus:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right"><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>9.37</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">3.17</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">11.21</p>

<tr>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">1.34</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">6.37</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>What they could mean I could not imagine, nor did I worry very
long about them.&nbsp; I removed the wrapper, to find inside a
small phial labelled &ldquo;Pemberton&rsquo;s Drops,&rdquo; which
were described as &ldquo;a safe remedy for headache,
sleeplessness, and all nerve troubles.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dose was
forty drops to be taken in water or other liquid.&nbsp; I turned
the bottle over and saw a circular, red label, not much larger
than a sixpence, on which was printed in small, white letters
&ldquo;Grainger, Midlington&rdquo;&mdash;obviously the chemist
from whom Nora Lepley had purchased her sleeping drug.&nbsp; I
could well understand that she did not want her friends to know
that she took an hypnotic composition of this character.</p>
<p>Almost without knowing what I was doing I removed the cork,
and then with a sudden jerk realised what it was I had stumbled
upon.&nbsp; I smelt the unmistakable odour of bitter
almonds.&nbsp; Whatever the phial had contained when Grainger of
Midlington sold it to Nora Lepley, it was nearly full now of a
strong solution of hydrocyanic acid.&nbsp; I took up the glass,
but it <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>was perfectly dry and odourless, despite which I had no
doubt that it had been the vehicle by which Sir Philip Clevedon
had taken the poison.</p>
<p>The real art and science of the detective lies in building up
one fact upon another until the edifice begins to assume
intelligible shape.&nbsp; I am far from saying that a Sherlock
Holmes is impossible.&nbsp; On the contrary, I have met people
possessed as he was of a sense of intuition almost as keen and
certain as seeing and hearing in ordinary men.&nbsp; But they are
few.&nbsp; The average detective, though he may indulge in
theories, depends really on facts and is wise not to wander very
far from them.&nbsp; And he will find, if he is sufficiently
practised and astute, that facts breed facts, and that a clue,
even if it does not lead to the required solution, does often
produce other clues that continue the chain unbroken.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;clue&rdquo; that leads nowhere never was anything but a
false clue from the beginning.&nbsp; And a detective is largely
dependent upon what ordinary folk describe as luck or
chance.&nbsp; His skill consists in making use of chance and in
missing nothing that luck brings him.</p>
<p>The police have, in addition to the natural astuteness of
individuals, the assistance of a singularly complete and
effective organisation that enables them to push their inquiries
far <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and
wide and, when they have settled on their man, to weave round him
a net from which escape is all but impossible.&nbsp; By telegraph
and telephone, the police of the whole country can be put on the
alert, descriptions can be circulated in a few minutes,
information conveyed and facts gathered until the story is
complete.&nbsp; The English police work under some difficulty
since the methods of questioning and even bullying that are legal
in France and are frequently permitted in America are rigidly
forbidden here.&nbsp; English law really does try to live up to
the theory that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty and
that he must not be trapped into any unwary admission.&nbsp; I do
not mean to say that the English police invariably abide by the
strict letter of the law or always observe it in spirit.&nbsp;
There are occasions when it is worth while to take risks.&nbsp;
But, generally speaking, the law as it is and as it is
administered aids the criminal and hampers the police, despite
which, however, the latter are wonderfully successful.</p>
<p>Still, I can hear someone saying, many crimes go unpunished,
many criminals remain undiscovered.&nbsp; True, but one has to
remember that many criminals are known against whom there is no
clear proof.&nbsp; The conviction of a wrong-doer is a matter of
evidence not of belief.&nbsp; I am <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>acquainted with two persons, one a
man very well known in business circles, the other a lady of
great charm and important position, who, I am quite sure, are
murderers.&nbsp; The police are equally aware of the fact.&nbsp;
But so skilfully have the criminals covered every trace that
anything like proof would be wholly impossible.</p>
<p>And, again, it must not be forgotten that the criminal may be
a person of first-class education, alert mentally, intrepid, with
money, position and influence to aid him, and that he not only
prepared the ground before the crime without hindrance or
suspicion but was able to use his skill and resource in confusing
the pursuit after it.&nbsp; A burglar, jewel thief, or the like,
may be a person of the Bill Sikes variety, but he is quite as
likely to be a University man with a profession and income and a
wide circle of friends.</p>
<p>When brains are pitted against brains it is a straight fight
and the best brains win quite irrespective of right or
morality.&nbsp; The pursuit&rsquo;s most valuable and useful
asset lies in the fact that most criminals sooner or later make
mistakes, and crime as a rule leaves no margin for error.&nbsp;
The alert detective misses nothing of that sort and loses no
opportunity his opponent may concede to him.&nbsp; But when all
is said, facts remain the detective&rsquo;s chief stock-in-trade,
<a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>and it
is the connected chain of established facts that eventually leads
him to the solution required and the person wanted.</p>
<p>So far, for example, in this Clevedon case I had been groping
in the dark, hanging grimly on to the few facts I had; and my
blunderings and stumblings had led me to that little phial of
poison in Nora Lepley&rsquo;s secret hiding-place.&nbsp; I could
not see yet the full bearing of that discovery, but it was a new
fact which I had reached simply by following my nose.</p>
<p>Of course, I made a special journey into Midlington to look up
Grainger, the chemist, who, I learnt, had been in business in the
city about thirty-five years, was widely known, and very highly
respected.&nbsp; I made a small purchase, and noticed that there
were several bottles of Pemberton&rsquo;s Drops in the large
glass case that was full of various proprietary medicines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that stuff any use for sleeplessness?&rdquo; I
asked, pointing to one of the bottles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
seems fairly popular but I have never tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it dangerous to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;though personally I should say that all hypnotic drugs are
better left alone.&nbsp; The preparation is a secret.&nbsp; I do
notice that people who take them <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>come back for them, which seems to
suggest that they are effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went straight to Peakborough and interviewed Mr.
Pepster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something I want you to do,&rdquo; I said to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; Is it important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&nbsp; I fancy things are beginning to
move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; he retorted
grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for me, I&rsquo;m absolutely fed
up.&nbsp; The case is getting on my nerves.&nbsp; But what is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know all there is to be known about Nora
Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about Grainger, a Midlington chemist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what connection is there&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.&nbsp; I want to know.&nbsp;
Probably there is none.&nbsp; But I have traced prussic acid to
Nora Lepley&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in a bottle that came from Grainger&rsquo;s
shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a queer development, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know absolutely nothing more than I have told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Pepster nodded thoughtfully, then touched a bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the next train for Midlington?&rdquo; he asked
of the police clerk who answered his summons.</p>

227</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
STILL MORE ABOUT BILLY CLEVEDON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now I come to a very pretty and
pleasant little adventure which has its own place in the sequence
of events.&nbsp; Only part of it came under my own immediate
observation; the rest I had to piece together by adroit
questioning and the aid of a little imagination.</p>
<p>It began with Kitty Clevedon, who, as she was crossing the
park that partly surrounds Hapforth House, was a little startled
to see an aeroplane coming rapidly to earth.&nbsp; It alighted
only about sixty yards away, and a young man jumped out and came
towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! Kitty Clevedon, by all that&rsquo;s
lucky!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it was, which was
why I gave the order to come down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy! but you are a stranger,&rdquo; Kitty returned
smilingly, as they shook hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you still in the
Air Service?&nbsp; I thought you had been de&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, this is my own.&nbsp; I do it for fun <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>now.&nbsp;
Care to step aboard the old bus and see what it is
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He helped her in and then gave some signal she did not
comprehend, and up they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Kitty demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have no right to take&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; he admitted cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it would be a dull world if we only did what we have a
right to do, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let me get out, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said,
stamping her foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stopping you,&rdquo; he retorted, with a
laugh, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a longish step down to Mother
Earth&mdash;about 600 feet, I should judge.&nbsp; Would you like
to have a look out?&nbsp; You are not frightened, are you?&nbsp;
Have you ever been up before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, twice,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;m not frightened&mdash;of the aeroplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not frightened of me, anyway,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fierce, but not
frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled back a leathern flap, disclosing an opening, through
which he thrust his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ought to go in for
flying, Kitty,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
real sport&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like it.&nbsp; Motoring is
tame&mdash;and I tell you what, I&rsquo;ve a good mind to carry
you off to see old Billy and butt in on his honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>&ldquo;Billy!&rdquo; she cried, turning on him
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, steady on!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the old bus over if you jolt us like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must put me down at once,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must see Mr. Holt and Mr. Thoyne.&nbsp; Do you
hear?&nbsp; At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy Trevor saw that she was serious, and immediately gave
the order to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Kitty,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was only&mdash;it was only a bit of a joke.&nbsp; I
would like to apologise, if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot,&rdquo; Kitty replied
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only be quick, and don&rsquo;t talk until
we are out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will forgive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes; and now <i>don&rsquo;t</i> talk.&nbsp;
Let me think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made a safe landing, and Jimmy helped Kitty to
alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; she demanded, turning on him
suddenly, &ldquo;do you know where my brother is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he replied, evidently a little
mystified at her manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and did you say&mdash;honeymoon?&nbsp; Is
he&mdash;married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he
shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I put my beastly number nine foot <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>into it
again?&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t tell me it was a secret.&nbsp; I was
his best man, you know, and saw them off to Jersey for their
honeymoon.&nbsp; But he said nothing about keeping it
secret.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come with me to see Mr. Holt?&rdquo; Kitty
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go anywhere you say, anywhere at once,&rdquo;
Jimmy replied.</p>
<p>Kitty started off immediately in the direction of the village,
Jimmy Trevor keeping pace with long strides, muttering apologies
to her and imprecations on himself at intervals.&nbsp; As they
passed through the big gates into the main road they met Thoyne,
who glanced at her companion a little questioningly.&nbsp; Jimmy
Trevor was a very personable youth, and jealousy is easily
aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, this is Mr. Trevor,&rdquo; Kitty
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&mdash;he knows where&mdash;where Billy
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he does!&rdquo; Thoyne cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is&rdquo;&mdash;she began to laugh a little
hysterically, then pulled herself up&mdash;&ldquo;on
his&mdash;his honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His honeymoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne stood stock still in the middle of the road and gazed,
first at Kitty and then at Jimmy Trevor, who grinned
appreciatively.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&ldquo;It seems to be news,&rdquo; the latter said
dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; Am I making the
first announcement?&nbsp; I seem to have created a sensation by
posing as an amateur <i>Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; Why
shouldn&rsquo;t Billy get married if he wants?&nbsp; And she was
a deuce of a nice girl, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;the murder&mdash;!&rdquo; Thoyne
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder?&nbsp; What murder?&nbsp; We are talking about a
marriage, not a murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murder of Sir Philip Clevedon,&rdquo; Thoyne
replied rather angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have heard of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Jimmy responded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been abroad, and only returned to England two
days ago.&nbsp; Sir Philip Clevedon&mdash;why,
that&rsquo;s&mdash;then Billy is Sir William and doesn&rsquo;t
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must tell Mr. Holt,&rdquo; Kitty broke in, and
Thoyne nodded his agreement.</p>
<p>And thus it was that they came to me with their story.&nbsp; I
listened to them in silence and then put a few questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Clevedon arranged that you should be his best
man?&rdquo; I asked Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; I met him quite by accident on Midlington station,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&ldquo;What date was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was February 23rd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was February 23rd right enough, because that
was the day I had to be in London.&nbsp; It had been fixed up
with the lawyer chaps, Finns and Tregarty, who did all my
uncle&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; I went down from Blankester by a
train that stops five minutes at Midlington&mdash;beastly hole it
is, too!&nbsp; Looking out, I saw Billy on the platform.&nbsp; We
were at school together, you know, and then in France&mdash;good
pals.&nbsp; He pulled me out of a damned mess once&mdash;a good
story that, which I&rsquo;ll tell you some day.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
one of the very best, is Billy.&nbsp; I shouted out to him,
&lsquo;Billy, Billy,&rsquo; and he came up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
egg, Jimmy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I was getting a bit fed up
with my own company.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a vacant corner seat,
and he took it and we travelled to London together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time would that be?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see; it was the 11.23 at Midlington, and
4.7 in London.&nbsp; We put up at the Terminus Hotel, both of us,
had dinner there, and went to see <i>Jimson&rsquo;s Joy Ride</i>
at the Lyric.&nbsp; Then we trotted round to one or two places we
know of and got back to the Terminus at 1 a.m., and so to bed, as
What&rsquo;s-his-name would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;If we could make absolutely sure of the
date&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The date is right enough,&rdquo; Jimmy Trevor
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t come into a little wad of
fifteen thousand pounds every day, and that date is in red
letters in my almanac.&nbsp; But ask the
lawyers&mdash;they&rsquo;ll have it down&mdash;or try the
Terminus Hotel.&nbsp; Our names will be in the
register.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;you went to see
<i>Jimson&rsquo;s Joy Ride</i>, then to bed.&nbsp; Next
morning&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to Jersey!&rsquo; Billy
said to me, &lsquo;to get married.&nbsp; The young lady is there,
waiting for me&mdash;suppose you come with me and be best
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had four weeks or so empty and plenty of
money, so I said &lsquo;Right ho!&rsquo;&nbsp; The lawyers had
come down with some coin and didn&rsquo;t want me for a bit until
they&rsquo;d straightened things some more.&nbsp; And then Billy
got a telegram, &lsquo;Lost my luggage; bring some
clothes&mdash;Elsie.&rsquo;&nbsp; So off he went to a large shop
and interviewed the manageress.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want some clothes
for a young lady,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;all sorts of clothes:
nightdresses, stockings, whatever young ladies usually wear;
plenty of them, and some frocks&mdash;and you see that young lady
over there with the red hair?&rsquo;&nbsp; The manageress <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>cast her
optics round.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I see her,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;but you&rsquo;d better not let her hear you describe her
hair as red.&rsquo;&nbsp; Old Billy was a bit put out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but she is about the
build.&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll fit her will fit the
other.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was all easily arranged&mdash;anything is
easy to arrange, you know, when you have the money to pay for it,
and Billy seemed to have plenty.&nbsp; He came out of the shop
carrying a brand new suit-case containing about eighty
pounds&rsquo; worth of female garments.&nbsp; When he told me
about it I said he was a silly Juggins; that what the telegram
had meant was that he was to go to her flat and tell her maid to
pack another box; which is what she told him when we got to
Jersey.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do both,&rsquo; Billy said, and
we went to the flat and got another lot of feminine
mysteries.&nbsp; So we got to Jersey, and I saw him tied up and
then went on to St. Malo.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how I never heard
anything of Sir Philip Clevedon, and I bet Billy&rsquo;s heard
nothing, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is the&mdash;the girl?&rdquo; Kitty demanded,
quite naturally a little angry when she recollected the suspense
and misery she had endured through her brother&rsquo;s
unexplained absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Elsie MacFarren,&rdquo; Jimmy replied.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>I
knew her quite well.&nbsp; Miss Elsie MacFarren was a youthful
American actress who had come across with a boisterous Yankee
comedy, entitled <i>Chick Tottle&rsquo;s Turnout</i>.&nbsp; The
play itself had been a failure, but Elsie had been a success, and
had remained here to earn one of the big salaries the British
theatre-loving public willingly pays to those who take its
fancy.&nbsp; She was not only pretty, but clever; and invitations
to return to America&mdash;invitations heavily larded with
dollars&mdash;were cabled to her at short intervals.&nbsp; But
she stayed here proof against all temptations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I added briskly, &ldquo;the next thing
is to wire Sir William Clevedon to return immediately.&nbsp; He
must come back.&nbsp; His presence here will dispel a lot of
suspicion, and the story of his romance will counteract some ugly
rumours.&nbsp; We will meet them in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I told Pepster the story I thought he would never stop
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the absolute
limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come with us to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We duly met the honeymoon couple at Paddington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the hell have you been?&rdquo; Thoyne demanded
harshly.</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Billy echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my
honeymoon.&nbsp; There is Mrs. Billy Clevedon,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I interrupted suavely; &ldquo;Lady
Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round facing me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you, and what the devil do you mean by
that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Philip Clevedon is dead,&rdquo; I replied
quietly.</p>
<p>He stood glaring at me for a moment or two, as if he thought I
was mad, then, reading confirmation in the faces around him, he
turned to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, Elsie?&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir Philip is dead, and I am Sir William, and you are My
Lady, and, yes, by gad! I&rsquo;ve got pots of money.&nbsp; By
Jove! yes.&nbsp; Poor old Philip&mdash;he was a bit of
a&mdash;but there, he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; What a life it
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; I went on, cutting short his
excitement, &ldquo;that Sir Philip Clevedon was murdered,
and&rdquo;&mdash;I paused a moment or two so that I might get the
full effect&mdash;&ldquo;there is a warrant out for your
arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; he echoed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pepster interrupted slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t say arrest.&nbsp; The police are
interested&mdash;you see, your absence seemed to
require&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;And where the devil do you come into the
picture?&rdquo; the new Sir William demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;oh, I am the police,&rdquo; Pepster
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely,&rdquo; Kitty said haltingly, &ldquo;Mr.
Trevor has proved&mdash;Billy was in London on the night of the
23rd&mdash;an alibi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no alibi in a poison case,&rdquo; I
returned gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The crime is committed, not when
the victim dies but when the poison is placed&mdash;wherever it
is placed.&nbsp; For example, if I were to put prussic acid now
in some whisky which you were to drink next Sunday, I might go
off to Paris, or be on the high seas far off enough, anyway, when
you drink the whisky, but I should still be guilty
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the story?&rdquo; Billy broke in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did I put prussic acid in Philip&rsquo;s whisky?&nbsp;
Come, we&rsquo;ll get back to Cartordale.&nbsp; I am Sir William
and White Towers belongs to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to take
possession.&nbsp; And if anyone thinks I killed Sir Philip, well,
let them prove it and be damned to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with an angry laugh and stood facing us.&nbsp;
His lovely little bride thrust her hand through his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in that musical voice of hers
that had charmed huge crowds on two continents, &ldquo;let them
prove it and&mdash;be damned to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>But
her laugh was one of real amusement.&nbsp; Lady Clevedon was
looking forward to enjoying life and had no objection to a
sensation or two.&nbsp; Possibly she had found the honeymoon just
a trifle slow.&nbsp; Anyway, she made a charming picture of
loyalty and confidence as she stood arm-in-arm with her husband
facing those who were practically accusing him of murder.</p>

WHY TULMIN BLACKMAILED CLEVEDON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir William</span> and Lady Clevedon
settled down in Cartordale and very quickly made themselves
popular with their neighbours.&nbsp; Billy himself was of a
buoyant and friendly disposition, and even if he had been far
less genial, Lady Clevedon would have pulled him through.&nbsp; I
never met a sunnier person than she was, and if she had
designedly set out to dissipate any possible suspicion that may
have gathered round her husband, she could not have gone a better
way about it.</p>
<p>But if she had any such intent she did not show it.&nbsp; They
both acted as if they took it calmly for granted that any idea of
Billy&rsquo;s participation in the tragedy was futile
nonsense.&nbsp; Nor did they hesitate to discuss it, and
apparently accepted my interposition as a matter of course.&nbsp;
No doubt Thoyne and Kitty had explained to them my part in the
story.&nbsp; As they became more and more immersed in their plans
for refurnishing White Towers and in various social <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>activities,
the mystery dropped more and more into the background.&nbsp; That
was all the better for me.&nbsp; The necessity of consulting
other folk and especially of explaining, or of concealing,
because it more frequently amounts to that, is always something
of a nuisance when one is engaged in delicate investigations.</p>
<p>But I had a little passage with Lady Clevedon the elder that
was not entirely without entertainment.&nbsp; I was passing the
big gates of Hapforth House just as she emerged.&nbsp; I fancy
she had seen me from the windows of the lodge and had come out
with the intention of intercepting me.&nbsp; She stood with both
hands on her stick surveying me with a dry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Detective, you haven&rsquo;t yet discovered who
killed Philip Clevedon,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;But knowledge isn&rsquo;t proof and there
are libel laws to be watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an easy way of getting out of it,&rdquo; she
cried mockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A detective ought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not a detective,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not, that&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; she
agreed grimly, as she turned abruptly and began walking towards
Hapforth House.</p>
<p>When I reached Stone Hollow again, I found <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>waiting for
me a little wizened man with indeterminate features and a general
air of dilapidation, though his eyes under shaggy grey brows were
bright and piercing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Stillman!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you at last, is
it?&nbsp; I have been expecting you for some time, but I suppose
it wasn&rsquo;t an easy job.&nbsp; Have you got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stillman sat for a few minutes gazing into the fire.&nbsp; I
knew his habit well and did not attempt to hurry him.&nbsp; He
was a very methodical person, with a way of arranging his
thoughts and choosing his words that was sometimes a little
irritating to those wanting to hear what he had to say.&nbsp; I,
knowing him well, merely waited until he was ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me to find out&mdash;&rdquo; he began and then
paused, glancing at me as if in inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Tulmin was blackmailing Sir Philip Clevedon,&rdquo;
I replied promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tulmin had some hold over
Clevedon&mdash;what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; Stillman some years before, and
had made much use of him.&nbsp; What his past was I did not know,
though I suspected that it would not bear a too detailed
investigation.&nbsp; He was certainly an expert burglar, as I had
more than once put to the test; he could <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>copy a
signature with the fidelity of the camera; he could empty a
man&rsquo;s pocket with the dexterity of a professional; he knew
every possible trick with the cards; he seemed, in short, to be
an expert in every form of roguery, and yet, as far as I knew, he
had never engaged the attention of the police.&nbsp; If he had
been a rogue, he had covered his tracks with singular skill.</p>
<p>But he may only have been, like myself, a student of
roguery.&nbsp; I was an expert pickpocket, an accomplished
burglar, could open a safe by listening, and would guarantee to
copy any man&rsquo;s signature so as to deceive even himself; and
more than once during my investigations I had found my
accomplishments extremely useful.&nbsp; I should have made a very
dangerous criminal, but I kept within the law, and I was willing
to give Stillman also the full benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; As a
sleuth, I never met his equal; in the patient, persistent,
unwearying, remorseless pursuit of an individual, in turning a
person, man or woman, inside out, in penetrating the most sullen
reserve and uncovering the secrets of the past he was
unapproachable.</p>
<p>I had the first taste of his quality in the Strongeley
case.&nbsp; He brought me some information and I happened to
remark that I must have Robert Strongeley shadowed.&nbsp; <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>&ldquo;Try
me,&rdquo; he said, and as I was just then too busily occupied to
do it myself, and had nobody else whom I could put on, I
agreed.&nbsp; He followed Strongeley half round the world, and
wormed out secrets that even Strongeley himself had
forgotten.</p>
<p>Since then I had many times employed him, and he always
promptly answered my call, possibly because I paid well, but even
more, I think, because my cases were nearly always
interesting.&nbsp; How he lived or what he did in the unemployed
intervals I cannot say and never inquired.&nbsp; A lack of
curiosity is often a form of wisdom.</p>
<p>I had placed Tulmin in his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;has been blackmailing the late Sir
Philip Clevedon and I want to know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there I left it.&nbsp; Stillman, I knew, would sooner or
later bring me the information I required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down to Ilbay,&rdquo; Stillman said, &ldquo;but
I could not get on board the yacht.&nbsp; But chance helped me
there.&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne came off the ship bringing Tulmin with
him.&nbsp; The latter went to London and so did I.&nbsp; Whether
Thoyne had given Tulmin an address, or whether Tulmin went there
on his own, I didn&rsquo;t know, but I followed him and obtained
a room in the same <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>house.&nbsp; Later I learnt that the house was one in
which Tulmin had lodged when he first came over from America and
before he went to Cartordale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America?&rdquo; I interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did Thoyne
know him in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the story,&rdquo; Stillman replied, with a
quiet grin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thoyne&mdash;Clevedon&mdash;Tulmin&mdash;all from
America.&nbsp; Tulmin had some money of his own, but Thoyne was
making him a fairly generous allowance, is still, for that
matter.&nbsp; But to begin at the beginning.&nbsp; When Sir
Philip Clevedon&mdash;er&mdash;died, Mr. Thoyne offered Tulmin a
job as steward on his yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tulmin say why the offer was made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no special reason, anyway.&nbsp; He was out of
a job and Thoyne wanted a steward.&nbsp; But it is a little
curious that Mr. Thoyne offered him about twice the usual pay if
he would go then and there at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled appreciatively.&nbsp; It was, indeed, a little
curious,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though, if he hadn&rsquo;t done that,&rdquo; Stillman
went on, &ldquo;Tulmin probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gone, because
he wasn&rsquo;t short of money.&nbsp; At all events he
went.&nbsp; But hardly had he got to know his way about the yacht
when a telegram came.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want you to go to London and
wait for me <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>there,&rsquo; Mr. Thoyne said to him.&nbsp; And that
seems to be the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tulmin see the telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Thoyne burnt that when he had read
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, of course, was Kitty Clevedon&rsquo;s telegram warning
Thoyne of my threatened visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky Tulmin went to London&mdash;what should
you have done if he hadn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; I asked, with some
little curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should have found a way,&rdquo; Stillman
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps an opportunity of boarding the
yacht would have presented itself, or I might have learnt its
destination and met it there.&nbsp; I should have found Tulmin
some way.&nbsp; But that telegram eased matters
considerably.&nbsp; I am much obliged to whoever sent
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all his confidences Thoyne had never told me why he took
Tulmin away, nor had he given me any indication that he knew
where he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to Tulmin,&rdquo; Stillman went on, &ldquo;I had
rather a lot of trouble with him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t exactly
an easy subject.&nbsp; But I got there in time.&nbsp; He is too
fond of his whisky to keep many secrets.&nbsp; And I have spent a
lot of money in whisky.&nbsp; At to-day&rsquo;s prices, you know,
whisky does cost money.&nbsp; But I had to drag it out of him
almost a word at a time and piece it <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>together as best I could.&nbsp; But
I think I have it straight now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story was very simple.&nbsp; As Stillman had said, the
three men had all hailed from America where Clevedon, known then
as Calcott had been an object of much attention from the
police.&nbsp; Tulmin himself was a &ldquo;crook,&rdquo; though of
rather smaller dimensions than the other, and they had
occasionally worked together.&nbsp; Then Calcott disappeared and
it was given out that he was dead.</p>
<p>It was some time after Calcott&rsquo;s ending that Tulmin,
finding the police in America inconveniently eager to make his
acquaintance, crossed over to England, which offered at once a
refuge and a fresh field for his operations.&nbsp; It was in
London that he met Sir Philip Clevedon as the latter was going
from a taxi towards the dignified entrance to his club.&nbsp;
They faced each other at the foot of the stone steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calcott!&rdquo; Tulmin cried, with a welcoming
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Sir Philip replied, with the
icy composure that characterised him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;Calcott,&rsquo;&rdquo; Tulmin retorted,
in no way perturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard you, but I don&rsquo;t know what it
means,&rdquo; Sir Philip made answer.</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clever bluff,&rdquo; Tulmin
responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard of doubles, of
course.&nbsp; But do you know that Felter is in
London&rdquo;&mdash;Felter was head of the Chicago detective
bureau, and a man whom the late Calcott had good reason to
fear&mdash;&ldquo;on some stunt or other and looking as foxy as
ever?&nbsp; It gave me a turn of the shivers when I ran up
against him suddenly in Oxford Street.&nbsp; I wonder if you
could persuade him to believe in doubles or whether he might not
want to see that scar on your left knee.&nbsp; He put it there,
you know, didn&rsquo;t he, and could identify it.&nbsp; Anyway, I
am looking for a job as confidential man&mdash;valet,
secretary&mdash;something soft and clean and well-paid.&nbsp; I
am tired of being a &lsquo;crook.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Tulmin actually would have done, or even could have done
had Clevedon bluffed it out, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But
apparently the latter funked the risk and the end of it was that
Tulmin was installed at White Towers as Sir Philip
Clevedon&rsquo;s confidential valet.&nbsp; That, in brief, was
the story Stillman told me, nor was it difficult to supply the
missing lines.&nbsp; Clevedon had never expected to succeed to
the title since there were several lives in front of him, but
they disappeared one by one, and accordingly he shed his Calcott
existence like a discarded hat.&nbsp; He was accepted on this
side without question or <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>demur, and indeed, there seems to
have been no doubt regarding his identity.&nbsp; The whole story
was extremely interesting, but I did not see that so far it
helped much in the solution of my own particular mystery.&nbsp; I
was a good deal more concerned with Thoyne&rsquo;s part in the
play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hold Tulmin had over Clevedon seems clear
enough,&rdquo; I observed reflectively.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t quite see how he managed to hook Thoyne on unless
Thoyne was also&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is nothing against Mr. Thoyne,&rdquo;
Stillman responded promptly and decisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
paying Tulmin to keep out of the way, but I think that is simply
so that there may be no scandal&mdash;no public identification of
Clevedon with Calcott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he knew that Clevedon was Calcott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tulmin says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure about that, but Tulmin was positive that
he did know, and that he was keeping Tulmin out of the way so as
to keep the name of Clevedon out of the mess.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
Thoyne marrying into the Clevedon family?&nbsp; Anyway,&rdquo;
Stillman added, with a queer chuckle, &ldquo;Tulmin doesn&rsquo;t
expect him to go on paying for ever.&nbsp; &lsquo;As long as it
lasts,&rsquo; in his own phrase.&nbsp; The hold isn&rsquo;t a
very strong one; and <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>I don&rsquo;t think myself Tulmin
will turn nasty when the money stops.&nbsp; His own record
isn&rsquo;t so clean that he need court publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite clear about it yet,&rdquo; I
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You said there was no special reason
assigned for Thoyne&rsquo;s action in making Tulmin his steward
at double pay, but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I was not quite clear.&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne did
not give Tulmin any reason when he offered him the job.&nbsp; It
was afterwards that he explained what he had in mind&mdash;to
make sure that nothing got out regarding Calcott.&nbsp; Indeed, I
am not quite sure that he actually explained in so many
words.&nbsp; But he knew about Calcott&mdash;Tulmin is sure of
that&mdash;and perhaps Tulmin jumped to the conclusion that that
was his motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I dare say it would puzzle Tulmin to know why
Thoyne should appear so friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made up my mind at all events that I would interview Tulmin
myself.&nbsp; Not that I had any specific aim in view.&nbsp; But
it would at least be useful to learn all I could regarding
Clevedon&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; Stillman&rsquo;s story had opened
new possibilities.&nbsp; If Tulmin could recognise Clevedon as
Calcott, others might have done so.&nbsp; It might easily be that
one would have to go back into those dead years to solve the
mystery of the <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>Clevedon tragedy.&nbsp; And among those possibilities
was Thoyne.&nbsp; He may have known Clevedon in America and have
had good reason, quite apart from their rivalry for Kitty
Clevedon&rsquo;s affections, to desire his death.</p>
<p>At all events I determined that I would have an interview with
Ronald Thoyne before many hours were out.&nbsp; I felt that I had
a legitimate grievance against him.&nbsp; He had known more about
Tulmin and Clevedon than he had ever told me and though he had
invited me to investigate the mystery, he had given me only a
half-confidence.&nbsp; I could at least teach him a lesson on
that, I thought rather grimly, besides which, somewhere at the
back of my mind was a queer suspicion that Thoyne had
deliberately thrown me off the scent, telling me, with every
appearance of frankness, much that did not matter, but remaining
stubbornly reticent on several things that did.</p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
MORE ANONYMOUS LETTERS</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">sent</span> Stillman back to keep an eye
on Tulmin until I could myself interview him and then set myself
to arrange a meeting with Thoyne.&nbsp; He was staying at White
Towers and I had no difficulty in finding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look very
serious, Holt.&nbsp; What is the matter?&nbsp; Have you made a
fresh discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cheer up.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say you look
pleased about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoyne,&rdquo; I responded, looking him straight in the
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever hear the name of
Calcott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent me a quick glance that was partly, I think, surprise
but was not entirely devoid of wrath.&nbsp; The name had
evidently no very pleasant sound in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I went on, interpreting his
half-instinctive movement in my own way, &ldquo;you <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>have given
me a lot of quite unnecessary trouble.&nbsp; Had you been frank
with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frank on everything that mattered,&rdquo; he said
sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought the fact that Clevedon had been an American
crook known as Calcott whom you had met in
Chicago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t get excited about it,&rdquo; I
rejoined equably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excited, the devil!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not excited.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as calm as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you would like to tell me the whole
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of Calcott, the crook, and what you knew
about him in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know him in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat himself down and ran his fingers two or three times
through his thick hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are rather a marvel,&rdquo; he said, with a smile
that was just a little rueful.&nbsp; &ldquo;How you get these
things sorted out amazes me.&nbsp; First one and then another,
you get them all straightened and leave no loose ends.&nbsp; No,
I never knew Calcott, though I&rsquo;d heard of him.&nbsp; But I
had known Tulmin in Chicago.&nbsp; I caught him looting my
baggage&mdash;it was in the car <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>outside my house and he was just
moving off with a bag.&nbsp; I caught him and thrashed him and
let him go.&nbsp; I recognised him when I met him here, and he
knew me also.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t interfere.&nbsp; He seemed to
be living an honest life as far as I could gather and I
didn&rsquo;t want to rob the poor devil of his chance.&nbsp; It
was he who told me about Calcott.&nbsp; You see, after they
quarrelled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarrelled!&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did&mdash;but I must have the whole story now.&nbsp; There
is more in this than I thought.&nbsp; If there was a
quarrel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne spoke a little impatiently as if he were tired of the
whole subject and merely wanted to bury it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a quarrel&mdash;is sometimes a motive for
murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought Tulmin did it,&rdquo; he responded
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know and then
perhaps you can leave me alone.&nbsp; Damn Clevedon and damn
Tulmin.&nbsp; Why should I be worried about their affairs in this
fashion? I didn&rsquo;t ask to be mixed up in it, did I?&nbsp; Of
course, I did it to help Kitty, and would do it all again, and
more for her.&nbsp; And all through the infernal foolery of this
secret marriage.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t Clevedon tell his
sister he was going to be married?&nbsp; The whole thing&rsquo;s
been <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>a
nightmare to me and I&rsquo;m dead sick of it.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t murder Clevedon and I don&rsquo;t know who did,
unless it was Tulmin.&nbsp; If you would find the assassin and
tie him up I might get some peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was you who took Tulmin away and hid him,&rdquo;
I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it was&mdash;what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you thought he was the
murderer&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I thought he was the murderer.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t think I should have involved an innocent man, do
you?&nbsp; Yes, I persuaded Tulmin to go away in order to keep
suspicion off Billy Clevedon.&nbsp; Kitty was terrified and I was
a bit anxious myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to this quarrel?&rdquo; I interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the rights of that, except that
Tulmin had wanted more money than Clevedon was willing to
pay.&nbsp; Kitty had told me, you know, that Clevedon had wanted
her to marry him and that she intended to consent.&nbsp; We were
not formally engaged then, though it was all but fixed up between
us.&nbsp; But the word lay with her, of course, and I was trying
to be as philosophical as I could over my dismissal when one
night Tulmin came to me with a queer, mixed yarn, of which at
first I could make <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>nothing.&nbsp; &lsquo;What have you come to me
for?&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to sell you a
secret,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; My first idea was to give the
swine a good sound kicking and pack him off.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could
tell you something about Sir Philip that&rsquo;ll make Miss Kitty
impossible,&rsquo; he added, and at that I waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ll blame me, but I don&rsquo;t
pretend to be any better than anybody else, and besides,
he&rsquo;d stolen her from me.&nbsp; So I listened.&nbsp; He told
me he knew something against Clevedon, who had been paying him to
keep silence.&nbsp; Now he wanted to go back to
America&mdash;Tulmin did, I mean&mdash;and had asked Clevedon for
a lump sum, and Clevedon had threatened to shoot him.&nbsp; That
is the best thing I ever heard about Clevedon.&nbsp; Tulmin is a
little rat, for whom shooting is a lot too good.&nbsp; But
Clevedon had stolen my woman and I didn&rsquo;t mean to lose any
chance that came.&nbsp; I said he could have the money if I found
the secret worth it.&nbsp; He wanted it in advance, but I told
him he&rsquo;d have it my way or no way.&nbsp; And then he told
me what Clevedon had been across the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I took him to mean that Clevedon was an
impostor and had no right to the title and estates, but it seems
I was wrong there.&nbsp; I went off to Clevedon next day and we
had a <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>right royal rumpus about it&mdash;that was the
interview described at the inquest.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mention
Tulmin&rsquo;s name&mdash;the little rat had made that a
condition.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t deny it,&rsquo; I said to
Clevedon.&nbsp; &lsquo;I come from Chicago, you know.&nbsp; I
recognised you months ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed impressed and
it was rather a good lie.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t
interfere,&rsquo; I went on, &lsquo;until you tried to steal my
woman, and we Americans are always ready to fight for our
women.&rsquo;&nbsp; That housekeeper woman didn&rsquo;t hear all
that, apparently.&nbsp; Then Clevedon denied the whole story and
we began to get angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;and when you said
you&rsquo;d find a way of making him give Miss Clevedon up, you
meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant I would get the Chicago police on his
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that Clevedon gave Tulmin a cheque for
&pound;500 the day before the murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, did he?&nbsp; Well, evidently Tulmin didn&rsquo;t
think it enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day was it Tulmin came to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that same morning, February 23rd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clevedon gave Tulmin &pound;500, which was less than
Tulmin wanted, so Tulmin double-crossed Clevedon and came to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;It opens all sorts of fresh avenues,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Thoyne murmured, with a
groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was hoping it would end the case.&nbsp; I
never want to be mixed up in another murder mystery.&nbsp; It is
the very deuce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose Clevedon, having quarrelled with Tulmin, and
knowing you also had penetrated his secret&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it was suicide?&rdquo; Thoyne cried, his
whole face lighting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you could prove that I
would&mdash;I would give you a cheque for ten thousand
pounds.&nbsp; It would settle such a lot, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; Suicide, yes, I think after all it must be
suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed eagerly at my unresponsive face, then shrugged his
shoulders a little angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied slowly, &ldquo;but then, what of
the hatpin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face fell at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clevedon certainly didn&rsquo;t stab himself with a
hatpin,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you may as well finish
the story,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;and tell me why you spirited
Tulmin away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite simple,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kitty was worried about her brother, whose absence puzzled
her, as it did the rest of us.&nbsp; So I offered Tulmin a job,
and he jumped at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>&ldquo;Did you tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, I&rsquo;m not a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was that why you offered to buy my
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed at the recollection of that particular
interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you thought me an awful idiot,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ve told me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth or otherwise of which will appear in due course.</p>
<p>On my way out old Lady Clevedon met me, grimmer and more
caustic than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any discoveries, Mr. Detective?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I suppose I need not ask.&nbsp; Have you seen the
<i>Midlington Courier</i> to-day?&nbsp; It has an interesting
article on the Clevedon Case&mdash;I forget how many weeks gone
and nothing done.&nbsp; It wants to know if the
police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have nothing to do with the police,&rdquo; I
interrupted smilingly.</p>
<p>Pepster, whom I found awaiting me at Stone Hollow, began on
the newspaper article as soon as we met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; he cried, waving the
cutting as if it had been a flag.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you read
it?&nbsp; &lsquo;Unfortunately, we cannot <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>congratulate the police, who seem to have been waiting,
like the famous Micawber, for something to turn up.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, newspaper writers are very fond of dragging Mr.
Micawber in,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
overworked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Micawber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I rejoined, with a quiet laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should feel like that if I belonged to the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re in the case, anyway,&rdquo; Pepster
said tartly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that reminds me.&nbsp; I have some
news for you.&nbsp; At least, I think I have.&nbsp; But with you
one never knows.&nbsp; Quite likely you have it all entered up
already.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of Mary Grainger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;ve got a novelty at last.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s daughter to Grainger, the Midlington chemist.&nbsp;
Did you know he had a daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, does she live at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t <i>live</i> anywhere, she&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head to express a negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it really is one to me,&rdquo; he said, with an
air of great satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;it is one to you if it
means anything.&nbsp; I take it there is more behind.&nbsp; The
<a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>decease
of a young lady I never met is hardly a matter for excitement in
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is more behind,&rdquo; he said slowly,
nodding his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is, for instance, Nora
Lepley behind.&nbsp; She and Mary Grainger both attended the High
School in Midlington and have been for years inseparable
friends.&nbsp; Nora frequently spent weeks at a time with the
Graingers at Midlington and apparently had the run of the
shop.&nbsp; She goes frequently to see the old man even
now.&nbsp; She was there one day last week.&nbsp; Now
suppose&mdash;well, Nora Lepley could have got the prussic acid
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly one to you,&rdquo; I agreed, slowly and
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something else,&rdquo; Pepster went on, taking
out his wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More anonymous letters?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed them across to me.&nbsp; One was a fragment of blue
paper, on which was printed in red ink:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THOYNE IS STILL AT<br
/>
LIBERTY.&nbsp; WHY?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other was a picture postcard&mdash;a view of <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>the
Midlington Parish Church&mdash;and the message, in pencil,
ran:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">WHY ARE YOU
PROTECTING<br />
THOYNE.&nbsp; HAS HE PAID YOU?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t sent open like that,&rdquo; Pepster
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It came in an envelope.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a popular card, printed by the hundred and sold by every
stationer in Midlington.&nbsp; Somebody seems to have a rare
grudge against Thoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know anything of these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor of the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a good idea&mdash;just to see how he took
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was anything in them it might put him on his
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not press the matter further just then, though I could
not help wondering what story there was behind this queer
series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a personal in the <i>Courier</i>,&rdquo; I
suggested, &ldquo;inviting the writer of communications to the
Peakborough police to send his address confidentially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No result?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>&ldquo;A personal in reply which ran, &lsquo;Take him
first and then I will.&rsquo;&nbsp; You know he said in one of
the other letters that if we would arrest Thoyne he would supply
the evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll sit still
and not interrupt I&rsquo;ll tell you a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I proceeded to recount the past history of Sir Philip
Clevedon and Tulmin, and Thoyne&rsquo;s connection with it.&nbsp;
Pepster heard me to the end in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case,&rdquo; he said, when I had finished,
&ldquo;is the very devil.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m half inclined to think
Tulmin did it after all.&nbsp; At any rate there are three of
them in it&mdash;Tulmin, Thoyne and Nora Lepley, but which is
which&mdash;or are they all three in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a possibility that had occurred to me more than
once.</p>
<h2><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
TULMIN&rsquo;S QUEER STORY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> my journey to London I
devoted careful and prolonged thought to the difficult problem of
Mr. Ronald Thoyne, whose exact place in the story I had by no
means satisfactorily determined.&nbsp; He had played a very
curious game all through, and though there was an explanation in
his anxiety to help Kitty Clevedon and relieve her anxiety
regarding her brother, the facts as I knew them would equally
have fitted a desire to throw pursuers off his own scent.</p>
<p>I did not attach undue importance to the series of anonymous
letters received by Pepster, and yet, in the light of
Thoyne&rsquo;s queer and frequently mysterious actions, I did not
feel inclined entirely to ignore them.&nbsp; I was fully aware
that so far I had not found the key to the mystery.&nbsp; Did
Thoyne hold that or was it Nora Lepley?&nbsp; Thoyne was an
American and, as far as I had been able to gather, came of a
wealthy and highly respectable family in Chicago.&nbsp; There <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>was
absolutely nothing of any sort against him and yet it seemed
queer that he had settled down in England and had apparently no
intention of returning to America.&nbsp; Even Kitty Clevedon was
not sufficient to account for that.&nbsp; She would certainly
have gone with him had he asked her.&nbsp; Even if he had not
actually encompassed Clevedon&rsquo;s death, was he privy to it?
Then I remembered suddenly&mdash;the first time it had occurred
to me&mdash;what the Vicar&rsquo;s wife had told me.&nbsp;
Thoyne, when he first went to Cartordale, had lodged at
Lepley&rsquo;s farm and gossip had coupled his name with
Nora&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What was there in that?&nbsp; Little,
probably; perhaps nothing.</p>
<p>And so I maundered on, my thought flitting from one thing to
another and back again, but with no tangible or coherent
result.&nbsp; I could not fit Thoyne into the picture
anyhow.&nbsp; If he had set out to fool me he had succeeded, for
all I had tripped him up so many times.&nbsp; That again was
curious.&nbsp; Practically everything he had told me had been
dragged out of him.&nbsp; Very little had come from him
voluntarily.&nbsp; He became confidential enough when he knew
that I knew, but he offered nothing.</p>
<p>I walked to the address in Bloomsbury Stillman had given
me.&nbsp; He met me on the doorstep, <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>and taking me into his room made a
few minor alterations in my appearance, not sufficient to merit
the word disguise, but enough to prevent Tulmin from recognising
me.&nbsp; I had never spoken to him, but I had been on the jury
when he was a witness and he might know me again.</p>
<p>And then I gave Stillman another mission&mdash;Grainger, Mary
Grainger, Nora Lepley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything particular?&rdquo; Stillman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what it will lead to.&nbsp; It is absolutely new
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him all I knew and left him to it.</p>
<p>When Tulmin came in Stillman introduced me as a friend of his
named Spencer and for a time we talked on all sorts of topics
until Stillman mentioned quite casually that Tulmin had come from
Cartordale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know Sir Philip Clevedon?&rdquo; I asked,
&ldquo;the man who was poisoned?&nbsp; A cousin of mine was
housekeeper there, name of Halfleet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Halfleet, yes, she is the housekeeper,&rdquo;
Tulmin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks he committed suicide,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, she&rsquo;s wrong there,&rdquo; Tulmin replied,
&ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t the suicide sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>&ldquo;Tulmin,&rdquo; I said suddenly, &ldquo;why, I
remember that name.&nbsp; You were his secretary, weren&rsquo;t
you, or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, something of the sort,&rdquo;
Tulmin responded, with a grin.</p>
<p>I was a little taken aback at his almost good-humoured
frankness.&nbsp; His was certainly not the attitude of a man who
stood in fear of pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you the
police are looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; What should they want with me?&rdquo; he
growled, sitting suddenly upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very well up in the case.&nbsp; It was my
cousin that told me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe, myself, it was
suicide,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but the police think
differently, and they&rsquo;re looking for Tulmin, who ran
away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his seat and thumped the table angrily, though
his face grew a little white.&nbsp; Stillman, who had been
watching him carefully, poured out a glass of whisky and handed
it to him.&nbsp; Tulmin gulped it down at a draught and seemed to
recover his nerve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you run away?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, damn you!&nbsp; Who said I ran
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thoyne knew where I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Thoyne?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My cousin said nothing about him.&nbsp; Is he suspected
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he responded, with a queer laugh,
&ldquo;you might guess again and get farther off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he did it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; he replied
cautiously, and then he added, &ldquo;It was Mr. Thoyne who sent
me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he do that?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So that the police would&mdash;think things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t do it you were a fool to
quit,&rdquo; Stillman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was a fool, that&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo;
Tulmin muttered, with an unpleasant sort of laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thoyne&rsquo;s had me for a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached out his hand for some more whisky, which Stillman
supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now,&rdquo; Tulmin went on, almost as if talking
to himself, &ldquo;that was why Thoyne offered me a job and was
so anxious to get me away.&nbsp; Yes, and then he almost pushed
me off that blasted yacht of his, and told me to come to London
and wait for him.&nbsp; I see his game.&nbsp; He wanted me out of
the way, so they&rsquo;d think&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t do it,
though I know who did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not allow so much as an eyelid to quiver.&nbsp; <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>If Tulmin
stopped talking now I might never get him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Thoyne himself&mdash;the swine,&rdquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw him give Clevedon the dope that killed
him&mdash;in a white packet.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll sleep all
right after that,&rsquo; he said, and laughed.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t far out.&nbsp; He put Clevedon to sleep sound
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Thoyne what you saw?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When did he give it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Clevedon called on him that night.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d quarrelled over a girl, and Clevedon went to&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know what he went for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Thoyne&mdash;at Thoyne&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I
followed him.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t hear all they said, but I
could see everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t tell Thoyne what you
saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I was keeping that,&rdquo; he said, with a
maudlin grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought it might come in
useful&mdash;later on.&nbsp; But Thoyne did it right
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what was in the packet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t possibly say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both wanted the same girl&mdash;I know <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>that&mdash;and Thoyne took his chance.&nbsp; He came to
the door with Clevedon.&nbsp; I was hid in the bushes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take a dose of that stuff, and it&rsquo;ll put you to
sleep,&rsquo; Thoyne said.&nbsp; And, by God, it did!&nbsp;
Suicide, no.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t commit suicide.&nbsp; Thoyne
killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he flung his arms over the table and fell into a
stupid, drunken sleep.</p>
<p>I glanced at Stillman, who shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No jury would take his evidence,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>I wondered for a moment or two if Tulmin had written the
anonymous letters.&nbsp; But then I remembered that they had
borne the Midlington postmark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been away from London at all?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even for a day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, he might have got somebody in Midlington to post
them for him, but I doubted it.&nbsp; I did not think he had
written them.&nbsp; His accusation merely came in queer
corroboration of their statements.&nbsp; But anonymous letters
and a drunken gutter-thief from Chicago.&nbsp; I should have to
get a better case against Thoyne than that!</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>I
stayed three or four days in London, having a good deal of
business with publishers to transact, and for that period I left
Cartordale and its concerns entirely alone.&nbsp; It was a visit
from Stillman that plunged me once again into the thick of the
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a preliminary report,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but as far as it goes it is simple enough.&nbsp; Miss
Grainger died at Long Burminster, a small village in the
Midlands, about sixty miles from London.&nbsp; That was some
months ago, and she left behind her a little baby girl, who has
been adopted by the people&mdash;themselves childless&mdash;with
whom Miss Grainger herself had been lodging.&nbsp; She wrote to
her father, it seems, but he refused to visit her or to have
anything to do with her child&mdash;said they could send it to
the workhouse, which, however, they refused to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remarked that this seemed a very good and generous action on
their part, to which Stillman replied with his characteristic,
unbelieving grin, that they were being well paid for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom&mdash;Grainger?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stillman replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not by
Grainger, but by Mr. Ronald Thoyne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoyne!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thoyne
again!&nbsp; <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>It seems to be always Thoyne.&nbsp; But what had he to
do with Mary Grainger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stillman went on with his story.&nbsp; He reminded me, in the
first place, that Mary Grainger and Nora Lepley had been close
friends, and that Thoyne had lodged at Lepley&rsquo;s farm when
he first went to Cartordale.&nbsp; He might have met her there;
though he believed&mdash;he had not yet actually verified
this&mdash;that Thoyne had been a patient in the hospital at
Bristol where Mary Grainger and Nora Lepley had both served, the
former as nurse, the latter as V.A.D.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is the suggestion, then, that Thoyne is the father
of this baby?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>But Stillman knew nothing as to that; it might be so, or it
might not, but it was quite certain that Thoyne was paying for
the child now.&nbsp; And there was another interesting point he
had forgotten to mention.&nbsp; When Mary Grainger went to Long
Burminster she called herself Mrs. Blewshaw, and wore a wedding
ring, which, in fact, was buried with her.</p>
<p>It was when she was ill and knew she could not recover, that
Mary had written to her father, who had replied with a violent
refusal either to see her or to forgive her.&nbsp; Happily, Mary
herself had never seen that letter.&nbsp; She died peacefully and
painlessly before it came.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>Mrs.
Greentree had shown it to Ronald Thoyne, who bade her sit down
and write a letter from his dictation, in which she informed the
Midlington chemist that his daughter was dead, and asked what
wishes he had to express regarding the child.&nbsp; The old man
replied in person, but had proved a rather grim, forbidding and
unpleasant visitor.&nbsp; He had refused to attend the funeral,
or to pay for it, and would not even see the little girl;
whereupon Thoyne had come to the rescue, settling all the bills,
and arranging that Mrs. Greentree should take charge of the child
for the ridiculously generous payment of two pounds a week.</p>
<p>I whistled when I heard that, and Stillman nodded his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a lot, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she wasn&rsquo;t his daughter, I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first lesson I learnt when I began my studies in crime and
criminology&mdash;because crime is not merely the commission of
an unlawful deed, but is of itself a complicated psychological
problem&mdash;was to distrust the obvious.&nbsp; Crime itself is
sub-normal, super-normal, extra-normal, anything but normal; and
the obvious is always likely to be untrue because there are
always people interested in arranging it.</p>
<p>For my part, I never believe what I see or <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>hear until
I have also proved it; and, accordingly, though it would seem to
one&rsquo;s ordinary intelligence a certainty that Ronald Thoyne
was the father of Mary Grainger&rsquo;s baby&mdash;possibly Mary
Grainger&rsquo;s husband, possibly not; but certainly in some
intimate relationship with the dead girl and the living
child&mdash;I did not take anything for granted.&nbsp; I had yet
to learn the other side of the story.&nbsp; Not that I had any
reason to suppose that Thoyne was better than his fellows, or
that such an entanglement was impossible to him.&nbsp; He
certainly had never occurred to me as a saint.</p>
<p>The story seemed fairly clear, though, of course, I lacked
many details.&nbsp; Thoyne had met Mary Grainger either at the
hospital in Bristol, or while he was lodging at Lepley&rsquo;s
farm, and then, after an interval regarding which we had no
information, the girl was found to be living at his expense, and
when she died he paid for the maintenance of her child.&nbsp;
Added to all this was the other ascertained fact that Nora
Lepley, in whose possession I had discovered the phial of prussic
acid, was Mary Grainger&rsquo;s dearest and most intimate
friend.</p>
<p>But, then, what had all that to do with the death of Sir
Philip Clevedon?&nbsp; Was there any connection at all between
the two stories?&nbsp; <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Certainly I could discern none of
even the most shadowy character, and yet I somehow felt that
Thoyne was the pivot on which the whole business swung, though so
far the key which would open the door of the mystery remained out
of reach.&nbsp; It was interesting, too, to recollect that
Thoyne&rsquo;s serious courtship of Kitty Clevedon had not begun
until Mary Grainger was safely out of the way&mdash;interesting,
but whether or not it had any significance, I could not say.</p>
<p>I told Stillman to continue his inquiries, and myself returned
to Cartordale.</p>
<h2><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
THE WRATH OF RONALD THOYNE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">want</span> you to come with me
to Midlington,&rdquo; I said to Pepster, whom I met soon after I
reached home.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going to try a long shot, and I
would like you to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long shot at what?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
know.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t quite reckon it up yet, but it seems
worth trying, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepster nodded, and waited for me to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those anonymous letters,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are going to see their writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&nbsp; And who may he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grainger, the chemist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s&mdash;well, anyway, I&rsquo;m
ready.&nbsp; Shall we go now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found Mr. Grainger behind the counter of his shop, but I
was just in time to see a skirt flashing through the door that
opened into the little room behind.&nbsp; That it was <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>Nora Lepley
I felt sure, though I did not see the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grainger,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;we have come to
see you about those letters you wrote to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrank back against the shelves behind him, and his face
went suddenly grey.&nbsp; He pulled himself together
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of any letters,&rdquo; he said,
moistening his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I responded cheerfully, &ldquo;you
promised to provide the evidence if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Ronald Thoyne been arrested?&rdquo; he broke in,
with hardly concealed eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald Thoyne?&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I
mention Thoyne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you were referring to
the&mdash;to Sir Philip Clevedon&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I even mentioned Clevedon,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>Grainger passed his hand wearily across his forehead, then
faced me once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, almost as if he had made up his
mind on a point on which he had been in some doubt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know nothing of any letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are not ready with the evidence you
promised&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;Of course, I know you promised that if Thoyne
were arrested you would provide&mdash;but then, in point of fact,
there is nothing against Thoyne, and we must have the evidence in
advance.&nbsp; If you know anything it is your duty to help us,
surely.&nbsp; You say you have evidence against
Thoyne&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you said so in that letter you wrote to the
police at Peakborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote no letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, if we did arrest Thoyne, as you suggested, and
then your evidence failed, we might be in a very awkward
position.&nbsp; Now, if you could give us some idea of
its&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door from the little room behind the shop slowly opened,
and Nora Lepley came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; she demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why are you badgering the&mdash;Mr. Grainger in this
fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned smilingly towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I responded equably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Grainger wrote to the police and told them that if
they would arrest Mr. Thoyne, he would produce evidence that
he&mdash;Mr. Thoyne, I mean&mdash;murdered Sir Philip
Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>She
blazed up in very queer fashion, and wheeled suddenly upon the
old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say that?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote no letters,&rdquo; he responded half
sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they are talking
about.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had gone very white, and his hands were trembling
violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; Nora said
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will be ill if you worry him any
more.&nbsp; I will talk to him, and let you&mdash;and see you
again.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;d better go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded to Pepster, who followed me out of the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wrote those letters,&rdquo; Pepster said, as we
walked along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that seems fairly evident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does it all amount to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should he accuse Thoyne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Thoyne murder Clevedon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be some reason for those
letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the reason is plain enough&mdash;he had a
bitter grudge against Thoyne.&nbsp; His daughter seems to have
come a cropper, and he <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>suspected Thoyne&mdash;yes, that is
why he wrote the letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him in a few words what Stillman had discovered
regarding Thoyne and Mary Grainger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rum story,&rdquo; Pepster said
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course the child is Thoyne&rsquo;s,
and that would account for the grudge, as you say.&nbsp; But it
doesn&rsquo;t explain why he should accuse Thoyne of
murder.&nbsp; He must have had something at the back of his
mind.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be wholly an invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Tulmin a day or two back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad! and where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In London.&nbsp; I asked him who murdered Philip
Clevedon, and he replied that Thoyne did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He replied&mdash;what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Thoyne did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recounted as much as I thought proper of my interview with
Tulmin.&nbsp; But Pepster shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s beyond me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It wants a lot of sorting out.&nbsp; But Tulmin&rsquo;s
evidence would go for nothing, and Grainger, if he knows
anything, won&rsquo;t speak.&nbsp; We must wait a bit
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my way up to Cartordale from the station I overtook Thoyne
going in the same direction.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;I am bound for White Towers,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am staying there with Sir Billy and his
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know,&rdquo; I said, when our
preliminary conversation languished a little, &ldquo;of anyone
who has a grudge against you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoyne regarded me frowningly for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, &ldquo;there is
nobody.&nbsp; I can say that, Holt, freely enough.&nbsp;
Clevedon&mdash;but he is dead, anyway, and there&rsquo;s no one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;of a girl
named Grainger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me a quick glance sideways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew Miss Grainger
very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We relapsed into silence which lasted for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you the story?&rdquo; I asked softly,
&ldquo;or will you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What story?&rdquo; he demanded roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of Mary Grainger,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no story,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
poor girl is dead.&nbsp; Let her rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t talk about it&mdash;about
her.&nbsp; She is dead, and death ends all stories.&nbsp; Leave
it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;But if I have a story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Clevedons might be interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no business of theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might not agree with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it has nothing to do with them.&nbsp; The
girl&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is more in it than that&mdash;her father
isn&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of her father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says you murdered Philip Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood speechless for a moment or two, then turned away with
a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What blasted foolery have you in mind now?&nbsp; You are a
damned fool, the damndest of damned fools.&nbsp; I have never
seen Miss Grainger&rsquo;s father, and he has never seen
me.&nbsp; I am getting sick of the very sight of you about.&nbsp;
You persistently follow me up as if you thought that I killed
Clevedon.&nbsp; Well, if you do think so, why not arrest me and
have done with it.&nbsp; I would sooner face a jury and take my
trial than put up with this perpetual persecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your own fault,&rdquo; I returned equably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will tell me nothing, and your whole attitude is a
challenge.&nbsp; You kept secret your knowledge of
Clevedon&rsquo;s past, but I found <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>that out.&nbsp; You did not tell me
where Tulmin was, but I tracked him down.&nbsp; You have said
nothing about Mary Grainger.&nbsp; Then there was
Clevedon&rsquo;s visit to you on the night of his death, and the
medicine you handed him which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have committed murder,&rdquo; he cried, turning
on me with a savage intensity which betokened the inward strain,
&ldquo;but I am nearer to it at this moment than I ever thought I
should be.&nbsp; If I stay here I shan&rsquo;t be able to trust
myself.&nbsp; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left me abruptly, and vaulting a low rubble wall, made off
at a quick pace across some fields which gave him a short cut to
White Towers.</p>
<p>But in something under two hours he had joined me at Stone
Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologise,&rdquo; he said, as he strode into my
study.&nbsp; &ldquo;I apologise for everything I said.&nbsp; You
were right, and I was a fool.&nbsp; You told me that Grainger had
accused me of murdering Clevedon.&nbsp; Well, now he has written
to Billy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the murder?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, damn the murder&mdash;something a lot worse than
that,&rdquo; he responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;He accuses me of
bigamy&mdash;says I have a wife living.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got to
<a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>be
sorted out now&mdash;because of Kitty&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve come
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a fragment of paper from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a copy of the infernal thing,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter was terse, and to the point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Sir</i>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Ronald Thoyne</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>I
understand</i>, <i>is engaged to marry Miss Kitty Clevedon</i>,
<i>has been guilty of bigamy</i>.&nbsp; <i>He may have a wife now
living</i>, <i>but I cannot say that for certain</i>.&nbsp;
<i>All I know is that he married my daughter under false
pretences</i>, <i>and then</i>, <i>when he had tired of her</i>,
<i>told her he had a wife living in America</i>.&nbsp; <i>He is
keeping her child</i>&mdash;<i>his child</i>.&nbsp; <i>I advise
you to institute careful inquiries into these statements</i>,
<i>which you will find can easily be substantiated</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The child is being cared for by some people named
Greentree</i>, <i>who live at Long Burminster</i>, <i>and Mr.
Thoyne is contributing two pounds a week for her
maintenance</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Yours truly</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Robert
Grainger</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Thoyne demanded, &ldquo;and what do you
think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&ldquo;It is true about the child and the two pounds a
week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone know the real story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nora Lepley knows all about it.&nbsp; She is at
White Towers now.&nbsp; I want you to come back with me and
straighten it out.&nbsp; Then we will see Grainger
together.&nbsp; It has got to be cleared up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
come.&nbsp; And, Thoyne, did you ever suffer from
sleeplessness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil has that to do&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing, but did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;at intervals.&nbsp; It is a legacy from the
war, a result of being gassed.&nbsp; Perhaps for a fortnight I
may not be able to sleep, and then it passes, and I am all right
for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can manage without.&nbsp; I have a horror of
drugs.&nbsp; But occasionally a dose of Pemberton&rsquo;s
Drops&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any by you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I gave the last bottle to Clevedon.&nbsp; He looked
rotten, and, I think, felt worse even than he looked.&nbsp; I
hated the fellow, but I couldn&rsquo;t help pitying
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;He called on you earlier on the night of
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was when you gave him the bottle of
Pemberton&rsquo;s Drops?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; Let us get on to White Towers, and have
a word with Nora Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on our way I called at the post office and had a long
conversation on the telephone with Detective Pepster.</p>
<h2><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>CHAPTER XXV<br />
THE STORY OF MARY GRAINGER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> White Towers we found the family
party assembled, apparently awaiting our coming, though old Lady
Clevedon, grim, forbidding and unbelieving, flung up her hands as
I approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may you be doing here, Mr. Detective?&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a family council, and
strangers&mdash;besides, what have you to do with this?&nbsp; It
is the other mystery you are engaged on, and you might as well
not have been, for all the good it has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; Billy Clevedon interposed, a
little brusquely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holt is here at my
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we might all sit down&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who killed Sir Philip Clevedon?&rdquo; the
old lady demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do know who killed Sir
Philip Clevedon, and before this evening is out I shall probably
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>&ldquo;Has this&mdash;this other business anything to
do with it?&rdquo; the old lady asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything to do with it,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, now, let us straighten this out first.&nbsp; I will
tell you what I know as fact, and Thoyne can supply any
embroidery that may be necessary.&nbsp; In the first place, Miss
Grainger&mdash;that is Robert Grainger&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;and
Thoyne were in the hospital at Bristol at the same time.&nbsp;
They left within a few days of each other, Thoyne first and the
girl a day or two later.&nbsp; That is fact.&nbsp; Then comes a
long interval.&nbsp; When next Mary Grainger is seen she is
living in Long Burminster with her baby girl.&nbsp; Whether
Thoyne was actually keeping her then, I don&rsquo;t know, but
after her death he paid her debt to her landlady and all the
funeral expenses, and since then he has paid two pounds a week
for the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much if she is his daughter,&rdquo; the old lady
interposed bitingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a good deal if she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I
retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you think she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything except what I have told
you, I deal only in facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he keep a baby girl if she isn&rsquo;t
his daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is a conundrum&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if it is a suspicion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;it is merely a
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; Then Thoyne himself will, sooner or later,
supply the answer.&nbsp; But I have not finished my record
yet.&nbsp; Just before she died, Mary Grainger wrote to her
father, telling him she had secretly married an American soldier,
who was in hospital in Bristol, only to find later that he had
already a wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald Thoyne is an American,&rdquo; old Lady Clevedon
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard so,&rdquo; I rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
that is the story.&nbsp; Those are the ascertained facts.&nbsp;
It is Thoyne&rsquo;s turn now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before he says anything,&rdquo; Kitty Clevedon
interposed suddenly, &ldquo;I want to tell you all that I
don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The detective man said they were <i>facts</i>,&rdquo;
the old lady remarked dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Kitty retorted, flushing hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that there was any perhaps about
it,&rdquo; old Lady Clevedon replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story, as far as Holt has told it, is perfectly
true,&rdquo; Thoyne said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But now there is
one other person who knows the whole truth, and I want you to ask
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her!&nbsp; Who?&rdquo; Lady Clevedon demanded.</p>
<p><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>&ldquo;Nora Lepley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nora&mdash;Lepley, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a V.A.D. in the hospital where Miss Grainger
was a nurse,&rdquo; I interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, she may
know&mdash;if we could send for her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in the house now,&rdquo; the younger Lady
Clevedon chimed in, speaking for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will ring for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora came, and I handed her a chair.&nbsp; For a moment she
hesitated, then sat down with a glance round the semicircle of
perhaps not very friendly faces.&nbsp; I sat back watching the
girl closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Mr. Detective, ask her what you want to
know,&rdquo; old Lady Clevedon rasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, yes,
it&rsquo;s your job.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to fill in your
interval, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at Thoyne, who nodded affirmatively, and then I
turned to Nora Lepley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You served as a V.A.D. in a hospital in Bristol,&rdquo;
I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary Grainger was there as a nurse.&nbsp;
Then Mr. Thoyne came in as a patient.&nbsp; You remember all
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were there when Mary left, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I had come home.&nbsp; I
turned up ill and they sent me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>&ldquo;Then you were not at Bristol when Miss Grainger
ran away with Mr. Thoyne and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran away!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;With Mr.
Thoyne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat straight up in her chair and laughed in my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary didn&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was married.&nbsp; I was there as her
bridesmaid.&nbsp; I met them in London specially for it, and Mr.
Thoyne was there, too, as best man.&nbsp; She married an American
named Blewshaw.&nbsp; He was a patient in the hospital, like Mr.
Thoyne.&nbsp; The marriage had to be kept secret because Mr.
Blewshaw&rsquo;s father would object.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like
it, neither did Mr. Thoyne.&nbsp; He told me so.&nbsp; But it was
Mary&rsquo;s business, not ours, and she had agreed.&nbsp; They
took a flat in London&mdash;oh, I know what you mean.&nbsp; When
she died, Mr. Thoyne was paying for her, and he has kept her baby
since.&nbsp; But that was because he had introduced Blewshaw to
her, and Blewshaw had let her down.&nbsp; He thought he was in
some sort of way responsible.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t see it myself
but he did.&nbsp; Blewshaw went off to America, and she followed
him, only to find that he had a wife there already.&nbsp; When
she discovered that she came back to England&mdash;she
wouldn&rsquo;t touch the money Blewshaw offered <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>her&mdash;and tried to earn her living.&nbsp; But she
didn&rsquo;t tell anyone, not me, not her father.&nbsp; Mr.
Thoyne found her just as she was almost at her last gasp, and he
looked after her.&nbsp; Her father would have nothing to do with
her nor with her baby.&nbsp; Mr. Thoyne found her quite
accidentally, and he told me about her.&nbsp; I went down to Long
Burminster to see her.&nbsp; That is the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoyne comes well out of it, anyway,&rdquo; I said
cheerfully.</p>
<p>Kitty went to him and kissed him, and I think with very little
provocation would have kissed me too.&nbsp; She had loyally
asserted her belief in him, and possibly had actually persuaded
herself that it was genuine.&nbsp; But it was easy to see that
she was enormously relieved when she heard Nora Lepley&rsquo;s
corroboration.&nbsp; After all, Mary Grainger had been a very
pretty girl, and Thoyne was only a man.</p>
<p>When Nora had gone, Thoyne told us Mary Grainger&rsquo;s story
in more detail, though I can summarise it here in a few
lines.&nbsp; It was just as she had recounted it to him, with
annotations where necessary, from Mr. and Mrs. Job
Greentree.&nbsp; Mary found work at first in Liverpool, where she
landed on her return to England, and then, when that failed her,
she left her baby <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>with the people with whom she had been lodging, and set
out to walk to London, a mad project, as it seemed, though she
did better than one might expect.</p>
<p>Many helped her on the way, and eventually she reached a
little Midlands village, still over sixty miles from her
destination.&nbsp; It had grown dark, and was raining heavily;
and as she stood in the shadow, gazing rather longingly at a
warmly lighted inn, the door of which stood invitingly open,
revealing an interior that seemed to be all bright reds and warm
browns, and which, at all events, promised shelter, a heavy
motor-van, on the sides and back of which was painted, in big,
white letters, &ldquo;Job Greentree, Carrier,&rdquo; drew up, and
from it descended a big man muffled in enormous coats, and
sporting a huge beard.&nbsp; He lifted three or four parcels from
the interior of the van, and strode into the inn, leaving the
door of the vehicle a few inches open.</p>
<p>Mary crept forward.&nbsp; Here, at all events, was shelter and
a means of covering a few more miles.&nbsp; That it might be
going in an opposite direction did not occur to her.&nbsp; She
clambered easily into the car, and, creeping into the shadows at
the far end, lay down on something soft, warm, and comfortable,
though whether sacks <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>or rugs, she did not know.&nbsp;
What happened thereafter was a total blank to her.&nbsp; She
lapsed straightway into a stupor that was more unconsciousness
than sleep, and lay thus, oblivious to everything.</p>
<p>When she came to herself she was seated, swathed in blankets,
before a wood fire that roared and crackled half-way up the
chimney of an old-fashioned grate, while, bending over her, with
a mug of steaming brandy in one hand and a spoon in the other,
was the motherly, anxious face of a woman.</p>
<p>The carrier&mdash;he combined the office with those of village
wheelwright, blacksmith and undertaker, and was known far and
wide as Job&mdash;had drawn up with a rattle at the door of the
cottage that stood alongside the smithy, had dismounted and
lumbered round to the back of his van.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rum un&mdash;it is an&rsquo;
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the cottage was open, sending a shaft of warm
light across the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! hallo! Mother, come here and look at
this,&rdquo; the big man shouted.</p>
<p>The woman standing in the porch caught a wrap from one of the
hooks behind the door and flung it over her head, then went to
the <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>car,
where her husband stood with the light of his electric lantern
blazing upon Mary, who lay wet through and motionless from utter
weariness and exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl!&nbsp; Who is she, Job?&rdquo; the woman
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the bearded man
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw her before.&nbsp; I wonder
where she got in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pick her up and bring her through,&rdquo; the
woman said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t lie
there&mdash;she&rsquo;s terrible wet, poor dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearded man stooped down, and, lifting Mary as if she had
been a doll, strode with her into the house and placed her in an
easy chair before a roaring fire in the warm, well-lighted
kitchen, and there she lay, with the water dripping from her
skirts and forming tiny rills on the hitherto spotless floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear, she&rsquo;s worn out!&rdquo; the woman
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you go and look after your van, and
I&rsquo;ll see to her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bed she wants, and
something hot to drink.&nbsp; You keep out of the way for a bit,
and I&rsquo;ll get those clothes off her and some warm blankets
round her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran bustling upstairs, returning in a minute or two with
an armful of blankets and some big towels.&nbsp; In three or four
minutes she <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>had Mary stripped and then, after a vigorous rubbing,
wrapped her in half a dozen blankets, until there was nothing
visible save a small, white face peering out from what looked
like a bale of woollen goods in a furniture store.</p>
<p>But the exposure and suffering had had their effect, and Mary
fell into an illness from which she emerged&mdash;it was a
surprise to those who nursed and tended her that she came out at
all&mdash;but a wreck of her former self, with her mind a
confused tangle, and her memory gone.</p>
<p>Physically, she made a little, very slow progress, but
mentally, she seemed to be at a standstill.&nbsp; And thus it was
that Ronald Thoyne found her.</p>
<p>She was seated on the long, wooden bench that flanked the
porch of the cottage, when a motor-car drew up suddenly, and
Thoyne, leaping therefrom, came towards her with long
strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it really
yourself, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment or two the girl&rsquo;s brows were knit in a
puzzled frown, and then she shook her head.&nbsp; A woman came
running from the cottage and laid a hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>In a few, rather incoherent sentences, she told him the story
of Mary&rsquo;s arrival and of her <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>subsequent illness.&nbsp; But she
had hardly finished her story&mdash;had not, in fact, completed
it&mdash;when Mary almost sprang at her, shaking her roughly by
the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My baby!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is my
baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soothed her gradually and when they had heard her story
Thoyne took her to Liverpool himself, where they found the child
safe and well cared for, a matter on which those responsible had
good cause to congratulate themselves when they received
Thoyne&rsquo;s very handsome present.&nbsp; Thoyne took Mary back
to the home of the carrier and his wife and there the girl
remained until she died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; Thoyne concluded, &ldquo;is the whole
story, which I never intended to tell, never should have told,
but for the suspicions that seem to have arisen out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a fool,&rdquo; Lady Clevedon the elder said
tartly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better have told me or Kitty all
about it and left it to us.&nbsp; We would have looked after the
baby.&rdquo;</p>

NORA LEPLEY&rsquo;S EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> now,&rdquo; Lady
Clevedon said, &ldquo;who was it killed Sir Philip?&nbsp; You
promised to tell us, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; I responded, &ldquo;but I am not yet
quite ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but dinner is,&rdquo; the younger Lady Clevedon
interrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose we have that first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I should like to
see Nora Lepley again, but alone this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily arranged,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is staying in the house to-night.&nbsp; But dinner
first.&nbsp; Are you really going, though, to tell
us&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have every hope of it,&rdquo; I responded and there I
left it, though during dinner I was subjected to a sort of
oblique catechism, chiefly by the two ladies, which I parried as
best I could.&nbsp; Not that they addressed many questions
directly to me but their conversation, ostensibly between
themselves, really amounted to that.</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>My
interview with Nora Lepley took place in the study, the room
wherein Sir Philip Clevedon had been found dead, though I
don&rsquo;t think Lady Billy had any particular thought in mind
when she sent us there; it merely happened to be
convenient.&nbsp; I was not sorry the room had been chosen,
though it had not occurred to me to suggest it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit down, Miss Lepley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
let us talk.&nbsp; But first of all I want you to understand that
I mean you no harm if you are frank with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she responded
a little sullenly, giving me a flashing glance from her black
eyes that was at least three parts anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;What harm
could you do me?&nbsp; I am not afraid of you.&nbsp; This is the
second time you have wanted me.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you believe
me?&nbsp; Is it about Mary again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it is about yourself this
time.&nbsp; Did you know that some time ago the police took out a
warrant for your arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo;&mdash;she sat back in her chair and
regarded me smilingly&mdash;&ldquo;Why should they want to arrest
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Nora Lepley was in any way afraid of me or even unusually
disturbed she did not show it.&nbsp; Her dark eyes, full of
slumbrous fires and <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>undefined passions, regarded me
frankly, and a queer, rather mocking smile hovered about her
finely modelled lips.&nbsp; She was beautiful in an unexpected,
unusual fashion, but her loveliness lacked softness and charm, at
least that was my reading of it.&nbsp; She might fascinate or
infatuate many men but few of them would love her.</p>
<p>There was not the faintest sign or touch of weakness about her
and one could hardly imagine her reduced to tears.&nbsp; Whatever
the trouble she was facing, she would fight to the end.&nbsp; One
could only try to entrap her with the odds rather in favour of
failure unless one were very well equipped indeed.&nbsp; I had to
try it anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to arrest you,&rdquo; I said, speaking
carelessly, though I was watching her closely, &ldquo;for the
murder of Sir Philip Clevedon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Philip Clevedon!&nbsp; Murder!&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, but I had nothing to do with
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stabbed him with a hatpin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was dead before&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know anything about it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know he was dead when you stabbed
him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t stab him&mdash;I know
nothing <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>about it&mdash;I never saw the hatpin&mdash;I never had
one like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I went on remorselessly, &ldquo;the
police do not tell all they know.&nbsp; Sir Philip Clevedon was
murdered with a hatpin&mdash;just so.&nbsp; But we mustn&rsquo;t
say that.&nbsp; Let us suppose he died of poison and that will
throw the real murderer of her guard.&nbsp; Or suppose he had
taken poison and was still living when you stabbed him.&nbsp; If
a doctor had been promptly brought he might have been
saved.&nbsp; Or he may have been dying and you merely finished
him.&nbsp; How you would stand then, legally, I mean, I am not
quite sure.&nbsp; An interesting query would arise over which the
lawyers would waste many words.&nbsp; Did he die from poison or
from the hatpin?&nbsp; Either would have been sufficient, but
which was first&mdash;hatpin or poison?&nbsp; You see, Miss
Lepley, the case is not simple.&nbsp; If the police arrest you it
may not be easy for you to wriggle out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I know nothing of it!&rdquo; she cried,
her voice rising a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;let me tell you one or
two things I have learned, one or two facts, just to refresh your
memory.&nbsp; In France, you know, the reconstruction of a crime
is part of their criminal procedure.&nbsp; It is not often <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>adopted in
this country&mdash;no, sit down, please&mdash;but it may be
useful now.&nbsp; I think you must hear me out&mdash;for your own
sake and your parents&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave my parents out of it,&rdquo; she cried, her face
reddening violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I
rejoined equably.&nbsp; &ldquo;What affects you touches them,
also.&nbsp; You cannot separate yourself from them.&nbsp; But we
won&rsquo;t quarrel over that.&nbsp; Let us go back to the
morning of February 24th, when you discovered Sir Philip&rsquo;s
body&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead when I saw him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I know nothing of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went through your aunt&rsquo;s sitting-room,&rdquo;
I continued, as if I had not heard her, &ldquo;and you noticed
the hatpin which Miss Clevedon had left there the previous
night.&nbsp; You recognised it and picked it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo;
she muttered sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in your hand when you entered the study and saw
Sir Philip asleep on the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead, I tell you dead!&rdquo; she cried
shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps&mdash;you say so, anyway.&nbsp; You went
up to the couch and plunged the hatpin <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>into his
body in such a way that had he been asleep, it would have killed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dead,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you stabbed him with the hatpin?&rdquo; I
inquired softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I know nothing of the
hatpin&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words came out a little incoherently.&nbsp; Even her
finely balanced nerves were becoming a little jangled.&nbsp; For
the moment I thought she was on the verge of collapse.&nbsp; But
she pulled herself together again, and sat facing me rigidly
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you looked round you.&nbsp; On a little table by
Sir Philip&rsquo;s side was a small bottle.&nbsp; Your first
thought was that Sir Philip had poisoned
himself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he had,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it was suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you stab him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more important still&rdquo;&mdash;I slowed down
very perceptibly here&mdash;&ldquo;why did you carry away the
bottle and hide it in a small opening in the rock wall of the
passage beneath the ruined wing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face whitened a little, but she did not <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>lose her
self-control, and sat resolutely facing me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted the world to believe that Sir Philip
Clevedon had been stabbed to death.&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faced me unflinchingly&mdash;determined, as I could see,
not to utter a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you want the world to believe that Sir Philip
Clevedon had been stabbed to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not move so much as an eyelid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it in order that suspicion might be cast on Miss
Kitty, who had been wearing that hatpin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her seat and passed her left hand with a gesture
of utter weariness across her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for your policeman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
let me be arrested.&nbsp; You have no right to torture me.&nbsp;
I would sooner go to prison.&nbsp; I would rather be hanged than
listen to you any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood up, too, and going towards her, laid a hand on her
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not willingly tortured you,&rdquo; I said
gently, &ldquo;but I had to learn the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have denied everything,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I admit nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>&ldquo;You have denied everything&mdash;and admitted
everything,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said softly, &ldquo;what made you
think that Ronald Thoyne had killed Clevedon?&nbsp; You were
quite wrong, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all&mdash;in the way you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I am saying&mdash;nothing at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the absolute truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came an interruption in the form of a low knocking at
the door, followed by the entry of Detective Pepster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;both well and
bad.&nbsp; I was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed me a document he had been carrying in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grainger&rsquo;s confession,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grainger!&rdquo; Nora Lepley cried, springing forward
as if with intent to seize the paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
mean by that?&nbsp; And where is Mr. Grainger?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; Pepster returned laconically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A dose of the medicine he gave Clevedon.&nbsp; Dead in his
own office, and with this paper left on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; I said, turning to Nora Lepley,
&ldquo;and listen.&nbsp; This will interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I read aloud what Grainger had written, and after that we had
no difficulty in persuading the girl to talk.</p>
<h2><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
WHO KILLED PHILIP CLEVEDON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has fallen to my lot to outline
the solution of a good many mysteries, but never did I have a
more appreciative or attentive or admiring audience than on this
particular occasion.&nbsp; To them I was a wonder-worker, who had
straightened out what looked like a hopeless tangle.&nbsp; I made
no attempt to undeceive them.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t worth while,
and it would have taken too long.&nbsp; But the reader who has
followed my detailed recital will know how I really blundered
through, how often I pursued false clues, the many side-issues
that misled me, and the patient, methodical and, on the whole,
not very exciting linking together of ascertained facts, which
eventually conducted me to the goal I sought.&nbsp; That is how
all detective work that is worth anything is done.&nbsp; The
result may seen brilliant taken by itself, but in detail it is a
curious mixture of luck and chance, with some amount of common
sense, and a little of what is generally labelled intuition.</p>
<p><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>&ldquo;And have you really discovered who killed
Clevedon?&rdquo; Thoyne asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned equably, &ldquo;you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected that,&rdquo; Thoyne rejoined, with a wry
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think you have suspected me all
along.&nbsp; I seem to have been the villain of the piece all
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you do me an
injustice.&nbsp; You were only one among half a dozen.&nbsp; Let
me tell you the story.&nbsp; It is very simple, and a few words
will encompass it.&nbsp; Grainger hated you because of his
daughter, and when you ordered that sleeping mixture from him he
filled the phial with prussic acid.&nbsp; His intention was to
kill you.&nbsp; That Clevedon was his victim was only an
accident.&nbsp; Clevedon called on you earlier on the night on
which he died, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t know how you discovered
it.&nbsp; I let Clevedon in myself, and not a soul saw
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, quite.&nbsp; He came to see me to tell me he
had resigned any pretensions to marry&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and
glanced a little waveringly at Kitty Clevedon&mdash;&ldquo;to the
young lady we both wanted.&nbsp; We were friendly enough in a
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&ldquo;You did not disclose this visit at the
inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the question was never asked, and I kept quiet, for
fear I might say too much.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo;
he added fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has worked out all right,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;though it gave me a lot of extra trouble and delayed my
solution.&nbsp; However, you conducted your visitor to the door
and stood for a few minutes in the porch, chatting to him.&nbsp;
You were to be relatives by marriage, and had no particular
desire to quarrel.&nbsp; You were willing to forget that he had
been Calcott&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calcott!&rdquo; cried old Lady Clevedon,
&ldquo;who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long story,&rdquo; I returned smilingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thoyne will tell you all about it some day.&nbsp; It has
no bearing on this case.&nbsp; But in the course of
conversation&rdquo;&mdash;I had turned to Thoyne
again&mdash;&ldquo;he told you that he suffered from
sleeplessness, to which you replied that you had occasionally
done so since you had been wounded and shell-shocked in the war,
but that you had found a very useful medicine, which you advised
him to try.&nbsp; You had got a new bottle untouched, and you
offered to make him a present of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>&ldquo;Then there you have the story&mdash;that is how
Sir Philip Clevedon died.&nbsp; He took the poison Grainger had
intended for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an escape!&rdquo; Thoyne muttered, a little
hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the hatpin?&rdquo; old Lady Clevedon queried
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was that an accident, also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but that is another
story, and a very curious one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had reached the most difficult part of my explanation.&nbsp;
I had to render it intelligible, without betraying Nora
Lepley&rsquo;s secret, which I had surprised.&nbsp; To put it as
briefly as possible, she had thrust the hatpin through the heart
of the dead man in the hope of diverting suspicion from Ronald
Thoyne, whom she believed to be responsible for Sir Philip
Clevedon&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I had passed through my aunt&rsquo;s
sitting-room,&rdquo; she had told me, &ldquo;I saw the hatpin
lying there on the mantelpiece, and I picked it up, intending to
return it to Miss Kitty.&nbsp; It was in my hand when I entered
Sir Philip&rsquo;s study and found him dead.&nbsp; I knew he had
been poisoned, because there was prussic acid in the bottle on
the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She explained to me when I questioned her <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>that she
had spent much time with her friend, Mary Grainger, in the shop,
and was familiar with all sorts of drugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the floor,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;was a white
paper, and when I picked it up I found on it some pencil marks I
had made myself.&nbsp; I had been into Midlington and had called
on Mr. Grainger, who asked me if I would deliver a packet at Mr.
Thoyne&rsquo;s house, as he had no other means of sending
it.&nbsp; Of course, I said I would.&nbsp; At the station I
looked up some trains on the time-table, and having no other
paper with me, I noted them in pencil on the back of the little
packet Mr. Grainger had given me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So was explained the mysterious figures on the paper I had
found in Nora Lepley&rsquo;s curious hiding-place.&nbsp; I
regarded her thoughtfully for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had delivered that packet at Mr. Thoyne&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought Mr. Thoyne had passed it on to Sir
Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he had procured some prussic acid from Mr.
Grainger, so that he might murder Sir Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and then it occurred to me&mdash;that if <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>Sir
Philip&mdash;that perhaps they might think he had been stabbed
if&mdash;if the hatpin was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it to protect Thoyne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she had been in love with Thoyne seemed evident; that she
would never confess as much was equally obvious; and I had no
desire to force her confidence.&nbsp; The fact was sufficient for
me; the motive I was content to leave in doubt, or at least,
unexpressed.&nbsp; That was the difficulty I had in telling my
story to my little audience.&nbsp; I was determined they should
not draw the inference I had found inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of the hatpin,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is very
curious, but quite simple.&nbsp; Nora Lepley, when she found Sir
Philip dead, recognised the bottle as one she had found in
Grainger&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; She had known Mr. Grainger for many
years, and had been his daughter&rsquo;s bosom friend.&nbsp; She
jumped to the conclusion that Grainger had poisoned Sir Philip,
and it was in the hope of diverting suspicion from him that she
took away and hid the bottle and&mdash;er&mdash;used the
hatpin.&nbsp; There is the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose somebody had been involved&mdash;Kitty, for
example, or Ronald&mdash;would she have spoken?&rdquo; the
younger Lady Clevedon demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>But I
spoke without knowledge, because that was a question I had
carefully refrained from putting to Nora herself.&nbsp; My own
impression was that she would cheerfully have seen the whole
Clevedon family hanging in company if that would have secured
Ronald Thoyne&rsquo;s immunity.&nbsp; But I did not tell them
that.</p>

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
